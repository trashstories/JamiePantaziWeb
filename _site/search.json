    "text": "Prison Gerrymandering\nPrison gerrymandering is the practice of counting imprisoned people as residents of the place where they are imprisoned. The US Census defines residence as “where they live and sleep most of the time” [@uscensusbureau2020CensusResidence2018]. However, incarcerated people cannot vote or participate in the community where they are detained, and they often maintain ties to their community of origin and hope to have a future there when they return. The practice of counting these people as part of a community in which they have no role not only boosts representation for people around a prison but siphons resources and representation from their home communities [@benvenisteWhatPrisonGerrymandering2022]. The community conditions of places with high imprisonment rates are viewed as both the cause and the consequence of over-policing and disenfranchisement through the Prison Industrial Complex as it has expanded in the last several decades. As more people are pulled away from their homes and counted in a place that does not value their interests, the barriers to opportunity are reinforced, and the cycle of subjugation continues. If the true purpose of imprisonment is rehabilitation, and the hope upon release is to participate in society fully, the interests and opportunities of these individuals should be considered by policymakers who will impact their future opportunities for success.\nAs of 2021, about a dozen states had ended prison gerrymandering which would impact the redistricting from the 2020 Census [@fensterHowManyStates2021]. Because of the details involved with determining where and how to count these individuals in their home communities, data has been made available about precisely where people in prison are from, and where they intend to return to [@widraWherePeoplePrison2023]. This information is valuable and unique because it provides a link to determine the conditions that both create an environment where people feel the need to imprison larger portions of the population and create nuanced solutions to reduce both the harm that leads to imprisonment and the harm caused by it."

    "text": "Mental Health, Crime, and Imprisonment\nMental health care is an important resource to ensure overall health and quality of life [@princeNoHealthMental2007]. The expansion of mental health care in the last few decades has been a response to a dire crisis that has long been ignored and stigmatized, and the benefits of access and awareness of mental health services are obvious to many who have utilized these services [@hortonLaunchingNewMovement2007]. Though access to mental health services is generally regarded as a positive influence on communities, the marginalized groups who often lack access to these services are the same communities who are targeted for high crime and imprisonment rates [@saxenaResourcesMentalHealth2007]. The link between access to mental health care, crime, and imprisonment is worth investigating to advocate for more resources to be made available for these communities and potentially prevent crime and harm before they happen, and as a result, reduce unnecessary imprisonment.\nThree major components of mental health care and its relationship with imprisonment have been discussed. The first is mental health care as prevention of criminal and violent behavior [@hodginsConsequencesConductDisorder2005; @petrasDevelopmentalEpidemiologicalCourses2008; @brennanMajorMentalDisorders2000]. Increased access to mental health care, especially on a large scale could lead to an overall reduction in violent and aggressive behavior, which comprises most of the crime residents are most concerned about.\nThe second component is mental health care for the residents impacted by the loss of a loved one or caretaker to imprisonment. Many people in prison are parents or otherwise supportive to other that they leave behind to serve their sentence [@wangBothSidesBars2022]. The social and economic consequences of mass imprisonment are far-reaching, and the individuals living through those consequences would certainly benefit from a support structure that values their mental health [@hatzenbuehlerCollateralDamageMass2015; @nosratiEconomicDeclineIncarceration2019].\nLastly, prison can have a strong psychological impact on a person, and formerly imprisoned people may bring that trauma back to their communities when they are released. People in prison more likely to suffer from a mental health issue, both because, untreated, they are more likely to be arrested and because of the trauma endured throughout their sentence [@cloudLifeSupportPublic2014; @quandtResearchRoundupIncarceration2021]. The damage of imprisonment on mental health can include family disconnection, loss of autonomy and lack of purpose, and unpredictability [@quandtResearchRoundupIncarceration2021]. Accessibility to mental health care may influence productive reintegration after release from prison.\nWith the new information about the home locations of imprisoned people, there are a number of relationships to investigate. The obvious demographic and economic factors should be considered and potentially controlled in many analyses. One spatial relationship that could be investigated using this data is the accessibility, in terms of distance, to mental health facilities. While there are many dimensions to the concept of accessibility, distance can be a useful indicator of at least when mental health care options are not available. Other dimensions to consider are the capacity of facilities, specific services provided, populations served, payment methods accepted, and outreach or awareness of services available. This analysis focuses on the dimension of physical location and proximity as an indicator of access to mental health care, specifically inpatient care for emergency situations."

    "text": "Prison Policy Initiative\nThe data gathered from the Prison Policy Initiative is cross-sectional data based on data from the 2020 Census and Maryland state data. The data originated as administrative data from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and was combined with population data from the Census. The Prison Policy Initiative collected, calculated, and combined this data for public use for various levels of geography for Maryland and eleven other states where prison gerrymandering has been overruled.\nMost of this data is from the 2020 Census. The imprisonment rate used the redistricting data from Maryland’s law ending prison gerrymandering to count prisoners as residents of their home neighborhoods instead of the location of the prison. The data was compiled using the data from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services which provided the home addresses of imprisoned people to redistricting officials to report them to the Census so they would be recorded in their home neighborhoods and not the prison’s location [@widraWherePeoplePrison2023; @RedistrictingData2020].\nThe original data had 1475 observations and the following 6 variables: FIPS code 2020, Maryland Census tracts, Number of people in state prison from each Census tract 2020, Census population 2020, Total population 2020, and Imprisonment rate per 100,000. The unit of observation for this analysis is the Census tract.\nThis data can be used to identify what characteristics are common among places with high imprisonment rates. Combined with demographic data about these locations and the proximity of mental health resources, this data can highlight areas in need of more mental health resources to reduce the harm caused by imprisonment and over-policing.\nThe original data is available from the Prison Policy Initiative website where the report was published. The census tract data for Maryland was copied into Excel, and the variables were renamed to be more usable in the analysis [@thejusticepolicyinstituteCensusTractAppendix2023]. The Prison Policy Initiative report provides thorough documentation of the data, its origins, and how it was processed. The variables have meaningful names, so there is no need for an official codebook.\nThe abolition of prison gerrymandering is still ongoing, so this data is only available in limited locations. However, it can be used to shed a light on the issue of prison gerrymandering and identify the common circumstances of places with high imprisonment rates."

Though the Census collects data about many different attributes at the individual and household level, the data for this analysis is aggregated to the census tract level. Four datasets were acquired from the online Census repository [@CensusBureauData2020]. These included the following attributes: Employment (2020) with 1475 observations and 562 variables about employment rates; Geographic Mobility (2020) with 1475 observations and 1122 variables containing general demographic information about the population of each tract along with records of what types of people moved within and from outside the county, state, and country; Median Income (2020) with 1475 observations and 483 variables about the median income in each tract for different demographic groups; and Urban and Rural (2010) with 1406 observations and 9 variables contains the number of households in rural and urban areas.\nIn combination with the imprisonment data, the census data can show correlations between the racial and socioeconomic characteristics of an area and the rate of imprisonment. As stated earlier, while this may not be enough to prove causation, it does describe the systematic ways that incarceration and the Prison Industrial Complex as a whole impact people of color and low-income communities disproportionately.\nThe data was originally downloaded from the US Census website as a compressed file with three CSV files [@CensusBureauData2020]. One file contained the data, another file contained the variable descriptions for each coded variable in the data file. The third file contained notes about the data and documentation about the methods used to collect and distribute the data. The US Census is a respected source for basic demographic information about each census tract. This is important to determine disparities in different areas that are linked to racial and socioeconomic status."

The data used for this specific analysis contains geographic and key characteristics of mental health facilities in Maryland. While some of these facilities also provide substance abuse treatment, facilities that exclusively provide substance abuse treatment are not included in this directory. The information about each facility is collected by a survey at the facility level; many data points are collected in the survey about specific treatments and capacities, but the information provided with geographic information in this directory only contained basic characteristics about the type of care, settings, operation, payments accepted, populations served, and others. Altogether, the National Directory of Mental Health Treatment Facilities 2020 provides a code for 103 different attributes for 235 facilities in Maryland [@samhsaNationalDirectoryMental2020].\nThe information is provided in a PDF available to download. Since the data is not available in a format that is easily analyzed, the information needed to be extracted and separated into a readable format for analysis. Each facility is listed with a name, address, and code for each attribute associated with that facility. The directory contains a key at the beginning to interpret each code.\nThe locations and services provided by each facility can demonstrate how access and proximity may be related to the rate of imprisonment in a community. People in jails and prisons are more likely than the general population to suffer from a serious mental health issue, and the carceral system does the bare minimum to provide resources and health care to these individuals while they are incarcerated, let alone before and after their imprisonment [@cloudLifeSupportPublic2014]. The availability of mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment for individuals who may be a risk to the community, as an alternative to imprisonment has more potential to increase public safety and the well-being of communities."

Information about factors that relate to emergency response includes the amount of the population without health insurance, internet access at home, or a personal vehicle. The website hosting the data provides metadata and details about each variable available.\nWhile the importance of these data for this analysis is primarily spatial, the variables about some of these characteristics could be useful for further research to identify other relationships with imprisonment rates of different communities.

    "text": "The Raw Data\nWhen acquiring observational data collected by another organization, there are limitations on what is available. Often a dataset will include many additional variables in addition to the variables required to answer a research question.\nThe data from the Prison Policy Initiative was already normalized and estimated in relation to population data from the Census. Because this element was already processed and calculated, there are no missing values. Several outliers exist because of extremely low populations of several census tracts, the imprisonment of only one resident shows as a high proportion when normalized at a rate per 100,000 residents.\nThe US Census provides hundreds of attributes at the census tract level, however, these are often raw counts of individuals or households for each category. The estimates must be divided by the total counts to calculate the percentage of the population for each census tract for equal comparison. As with many large repositories of data, these datasets are missing some values for various variables. For the useful variables missing values, they are scarce and random; the values can easily be imputed for the important variables by finding the mean within the county of the tract. While outliers may exist in some categories, none were prominent in the variables selected for analysis. The values for each variable are numbers (with the exception of the geographic identifier and the name of the tract), however, they are not always stored as numbers and will need to be properly formatted.\nThe data about mental health facilities came from the National Directory of Mental Health Treatment Facilities 2020 as part of the Behavioral Health Services Information System Series [@samhsaNationalDirectoryMental2020]. Since the data is in PDF format, the information needs to be extracted and parsed into an analytic format. Each facility name is accompanied by abbreviated codes that need to be converted into dummy variables. Since this is a comprehensive list of facilities, there are no missing values. The values for facility name and address are strings and do not need to be formatted; however, the address values will be used to obtain the geographic data about their locations on a map and in relation to each census tract.\nThe spatial data from the ACS is available from the Living Atlas with variables for both the raw counts and the percentages for each attribute as a feature layer for use in ArcGIS Pro [@LivingAtlasWorld]. The data did contain some missing values, but only in three observations and for variables not used for this analysis. Since the data came from a curated source, it was properly formatted as the appropriate data types for both spatial and quantitative analysis."

    "section": "Merging",
    "text": "Merging\n\nCensus Tracts\nThe imprisonment rate data was merged with several tables from the US Census. These were almost all an exact match because each Census tract has a unique identifier to link it from the data from other datesets. The exception was for the Urban and Rural data because that was only available from 2010 which had less tracts than the 2020 data. The 2010 Urban and Rural census data was joined with 2010 census tract shapefiles in ArcGIS Pro. The spatial data was then apportioned to 2020 tracts based on the area of overlap and weighted by population.\nAfter merging the census data with the imprisonment data, the variables with relevant values were extracted to removed unneeded information regarding annotations and margins of error. The remaining variables were renamed with more meaningful names to better reflect the meaning of the values.\nThe merged data from the Prison Policy Initiative and the Census were joined to the ACS tracts in ArcGIS Pro for mapping. Several variables from ACS Context for Emergency Response were added to the merged dataset including percent less than 18 years old, percent 65 Years and over, percent in dependent age groups (under 18 and 65+), percent of households with no vehicle available, percent with a disability, percent with Medicaid coverage, percent with Medicare coverage, percent with no health insurance coverage, percent without a smart phone, and percent without internet access at home. The new variables were renamed with more meaningful names to better reflect the meaning of the values.\n\n\nMental Health Facilities\nAfter extraction from the directory, the dummy variables for mental health facilities in Maryland were renamed with meaningful names, and the addresses for each facility were geocoded in ArcGIS Pro. The geocoded facilities were also joined the newly merged data by spatial proximity. The distance to the closest mental health facility from the edge each tract was calculated in ArcGIS Pro in feet (as the crow flies) and then converted to miles. The dummy variables for the closest facility was also added to the dataset. This process was repeated for distance to the closest inpatient mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility providing crisis intervention, and the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins. Using ArcGIS, the total driving distance in miles and minutes was also calculated from the geographic center of each tract to the closest facility in each of these categories.\nThe complete dataset includes the imprisonment rate values from the Prison Policy Initiative, the selected attributes from the various Census and ACS tables, and the name, address, and dummy variables for the the closest mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility, the closest inpatient facility with crisis intervention, and the the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins, along with the linear distance, driving distance, and driving time to these facilities. These facility attributes were chosen because they represent opportunities for an alternative response to a dangerous situtation that may be better resolved with mental health treatment than law enforcement and imprisonment. If individuals who are imprisoned were able to access mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment if they may be a threat, in a time of crisis instead of being forced into the stressful and prejudiced criminal justice system, immediate and long term harm could be avoided."

By visually analyzing the raw data, sanity checks, and validation, these issues were identified and resolved. In the imprisonment data, some of the total population values were miscalculated and were manually changed by adding the number of imprisoned individuals to the Census population values in Excel.\nCensus data contains many variables that describe both the attributes and the accuracy of the attribute’s values. Many of these attributes were removed altogether, and for others, only the annotation variables were removed, leaving only the relevant variables. Some of the relevant variables were formatted incorrectly and needed to be converted to a numeric format. Several variables contained missing values, and these were imputed with the mean value of that variable for the tract’s county. The last issue with these data was outliers. Because the imprisonment rate is calculated per 100,000 residents, census tracts with extremely low populations may have an extremely high imprisonment rate, even if only one person is from that tract. To resolve this issue, all tracts with less than 100 total population were excluded. Most of these tracts also had very little land area, and their absence should not impact the results.\nThe ACS data also contained some missing values, but these were not imputed because the variables are not used in this analysis. The total number of observations remaining after cleaning the data fell to 1458 census tracts from the original 1475."

The Black and White ratios were converted into majority dummy variables; the same was done for the homeownership and renters variables. The percent of the tract with a bachelor’s degree or higher, percent under poverty, and the unemployment rate were converted to variables to indicate if the value was above or below the mean.

    "text": "Access to Mental Health Care\nWhile only significant when excluding Baltimore city, proximity to mental health care can not only prevent harmful criminal behavior, it can serve as alternative for dangerous situations before they become criminal. Mental health accessibility is also important for formerly incarcerated people returning to their communities to heal from the trauma of imprisonment and become capable of reintegrating and supporting their community.\nWhile Baltimore has the highest concentration of imprisonment and proximity to inpatient mental health facilities, there are only four facilities in Baltimore city. Though the exact capacity of these facilities is unknown, the average inpatient capacity for inpatient facilities is [xxx], which is not likely to be sufficient to provide the necessary services for all those in Baltimore who would benefit. In addition to other barriers, such as health insurance coverage and transportation to facilities, more research is needed to assess the most effective expansion of service to target the neighborhood most in need.\n\n\n\n\nMap 2: Distance to Inpatient Facilities with Crisis Intervention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInpatient Accessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInpatient Accessibility: Excluding Baltimore City"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The United States detains more immigrants than any other country in the world. The US government, specifically Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), uses largely private prison institutions to lock up immigrants for indefinite amounts of time for a profit. The government denies detained immigrants access to court-appointed legal counsel and many other rights afforded to incarcerated US citizens. Because many of these prisons are private, for-profit institutions, conditions are often inhumane—lack of medical care is rampant; sexual, physical, and verbal abuse is common; and ICE often separates families with no meaningful way to communicate. There are two types of immigrant detention: those whom Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) detain at the border, often asylum seekers, and those whom ICE detains while living in the US due to being undocumented, missing a hearing or ICE check-in, or breaking the law. Immigrant detention harms many aspects of US society, including education, the economy, and healthcare. The implications of these policies harm the individuals detained and their families and communities across the nation. Though there have been some efforts to release some immigrants through parole, bond, and electronic monitoring, none of these solutions are as effective or equitable as community-based alternatives. Community-based alternatives are the best way forward. Community-based systems engage immigrants in the process and treat them with dignity while they pursue their new life in the US.\n\n\n\nImmigration is a crucial part of the US’s history and identity; immigrants have been coming to the US since before it was founded and have shaped the nation’s identity. However, more and more, these individuals, mostly asylum seekers and survivors of torture, are mistreated and detained without due process, legal counsel, or access to basic human needs. Tens of thousands of immigrants are detained every day in the US, some for months or even years at a time. The US government detained over 500,000 immigrants in the Fiscal Year 2019. Many must fight their entire immigration case and the threat of deportation from these detention centers. If they are lucky enough to afford an attorney or are detained somewhere where pro bono attorneys can assist them in detention, they may have a chance to win their freedom and fight their case outside of detention. However, arbitrarily high bonds and bond denials are common barriers to their freedom. The immigration process, like many other legal processes, is complicated and arduous; without access to legal counsel, it is nearly impossible to navigate it. Access to counsel issues are all too common, especially in ICE detention centers.\nThe detention of immigrants does not only affect those detained; it also negatively affects the family members of detained individuals. ICE detains many immigrants living in the US with or without status who have children living in the US, some even natural-born citizens. The trauma of imprisonment of parents negatively affects the educational outcomes for these children; studies show that the children of an incarcerated parent are more likely to miss school, fail academically, or even drop out of high school.\nIn addition to the emotional effects of immigration detention, there are also economic effects of these practices that negatively impact the immigrant communities. The economic effects of immigrant detention are most apparent for those whom ICE detains long term (more than six months). A 2013 study surveyed over 500 immigrants detained over six months and revealed that at least 90% were employed prior to detention, equivalent to around a $21,000 deficit to the community per person detained every six months. Detention not only separates families, but it also often pulls the primary financial support provider out of the workforce, making the individual unable to provide for the rest of the family. The same study showed that at least nine out of ten of the people surveyed had families that relied on them for financial and emotional support. Detention needlessly pulls individuals away from their families and jobs, taking money out of the community and worsening the hardships of already marginalized groups.\nHealth care inside the facilities where ICE detains immigrants is often inadequate and sometimes fatal. In FY 2020, 21 individuals died in ICE custody. Though ICE contracts with facilities require them to provide adequate medical treatment, many facilities fall short of this requirement. Chronic illnesses, like diabetes and hypertension, are common and often ignored by staff; most complaints, no matter the severity, are treated only with ibuprofen and water. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, ICE facilities have failed to comply with the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) guidance and, in some cases, tried to prevent detainees from even learning about the pandemic on the news by changing the station on the television. There is no question that health care inside these facilities is inadequate, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only worsened the situation.\n\n\n\nFor years, advocates for immigrant rights have been fighting for an end to immigrant detention. However, the US government has co-opted the phrase “Alternatives to Detention” to include electronic monitoring of immigrants through electronic ankle shackles, in-person check-ins, and home visits. This practice still restricts immigrants within the carceral system as they cannot freely move around without constant supervision and funds the same for-profit private prison corporations. This type of monitoring and control only increases the number of immigrants subject to punitive measures and government surveillance.\nElectronic monitoring may seem like a reasonable alternative to detention; however, it is truly part of the carceral system. Electronic shackles have been known to cause health issues and sometimes even electrocution. These shackles also bring with them a stigma that can make it hard for immigrants to find work or even be accepted in their communities due to the fear that they have committed crimes or that they may bring ICE to the community since ICE is constantly monitoring them. The same for-profit prison companies are responsible for supplying these ankle bracelets, so the same players continue to profit from electronically detaining immigrants.\nAnother alternative to detention is release on bond or parole. While this may sound like a reasonable alternative, ICE grants parole arbitrarily, and bonds are often too high for detained immigrants and their families to afford. The average bond for detained immigrants is $14,500, and there is no upper limit. High bonds also affect immigrants differently based on their race; Black immigrants must pay bonds that are, on average, 54 percent higher than the average immigration bond. Families and individuals that have traveled across multiple countries, leaving most of their belongings and assets behind for fear of their lives, often cannot afford these high bonds and thus must remain in detention indefinitely. Many advocate groups for immigrant rights have argued that immigrant detention must end in full, including the government’s “alternatives” to allow for a community-based system. Not only would this approach be much cheaper, but it is also more humane and gives immigrants dignity and a fighting chance to win their case. As one organization, Freedom for Immigrants, articulated in their report on alternatives to detention: “Rather than be incarcerated for months and years, immigrants arriving at the border would go through customs, receive screenings and assessments, a temporary ID, an immigration appointment and/or hearing date, and be assigned a community-based organization to help acclimate and/or guide them through the country’s immigration system and laws.” This approach would save taxpayer money, give immigrants access to the tools they need to fight a fair case, and uphold the dignity of all human life. It is important to remember that ICE has only existed for about two decades, and mandatory immigrant detention has been in practice for not much longer; immigrant detention is still a novel practice. For centuries, the US had managed immigration without the use of mass detention.\n\n\n\nMy policy recommendation would be to end the practice of immigrant detention; the US government must rethink and reinvest in a community-based system. Community-based alternatives are more humane, more effective, and less costly than detention. As an alternative to detention, community-based case management has a compliance rate of over 90 percent; that is, at least 90 percent of individuals appear for all their court dates and ICE check-ins. Studies show that when immigrants are treated with dignity and support, they will engage and comply with the proceedings required to maintain legal status in the US. The US government should stop detaining immigrants, both at the border and in the interior, and instead fund community organizations that offer case management for immigrants to ensure they stay in compliance with their proceedings."

In order to break down these oppressive structures, they must first be identified and understood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrisoners of a Broken System: Investigating the Relationship Between High Imprisonment Rates and Access to Inpatient Mental Health Care in Maryland - A Bayesian Analysis (Janurary 2024) in progress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPleading Change: Unraveling the Impact of Bail Reform on Guilty Pleas in Harris County - An Ex-Post Policy Analysis (December 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEqual Justice Under the Law: Examining the Impacts of Bail Reform in Harris County - A Proposed Study Outlined (May 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Price of Pretrial Detention: Avoidable Impacts of Pretrial Detention on Families and Children - A Research Proposal (May 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpty Promises of Prosperity: Prison Towns and Quality of Life in Rural Georgia - A Spatial Analysis (November 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnding Immigrant Detention in the United States - A Policy Brief (April 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnes Family Immigration Prison as an Adult Immigration Prison: Why Expedited Removal and Immigrant Detention Must End (July 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructing Bad Men: Literary Myths and Protectionist Masculinity (December 2018)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElias Boudinot: Editor in Assimilation (May 2018)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndigenous Identity Outside the National Narrative: An Analysis of Indigenous Resilience in Mexico (December 2017)"

    "text": "Summary\nThe United States detains more immigrants than any other country in the world. The US government, specifically Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), uses largely private prison institutions to lock up immigrants for indefinite amounts of time for a profit. The government denies detained immigrants access to court-appointed legal counsel and many other rights afforded to incarcerated US citizens. Because many of these prisons are private, for-profit institutions, conditions are often inhumane—lack of medical care is rampant; sexual, physical, and verbal abuse is common; and ICE often separates families with no meaningful way to communicate. There are two types of immigrant detention: those whom Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) detain at the border, often asylum seekers, and those whom ICE detains while living in the US due to being undocumented, missing a hearing or ICE check-in, or breaking the law. Immigrant detention harms many aspects of US society, including education, the economy, and healthcare. The implications of these policies harm the individuals detained and their families and communities across the nation. Though there have been some efforts to release some immigrants through parole, bond, and electronic monitoring, none of these solutions are as effective or equitable as community-based alternatives. Community-based alternatives are the best way forward. Community-based systems engage immigrants in the process and treat them with dignity while they pursue their new life in the US."

    "section": "Problem Significance",
    "text": "Problem Significance\nImmigration is a crucial part of the US’s history and identity; immigrants have been coming to the US since before it was founded and have shaped the nation’s identity. However, more and more, these individuals, mostly asylum seekers and survivors of torture, are mistreated and detained without due process, legal counsel, or access to basic human needs. Tens of thousands of immigrants are detained every day in the US, some for months or even years at a time. The US government detained over 500,000 immigrants in the Fiscal Year 2019. Many must fight their entire immigration case and the threat of deportation from these detention centers. If they are lucky enough to afford an attorney or are detained somewhere where pro bono attorneys can assist them in detention, they may have a chance to win their freedom and fight their case outside of detention. However, arbitrarily high bonds and bond denials are common barriers to their freedom. The immigration process, like many other legal processes, is complicated and arduous; without access to legal counsel, it is nearly impossible to navigate it. Access to counsel issues are all too common, especially in ICE detention centers.\nThe detention of immigrants does not only affect those detained; it also negatively affects the family members of detained individuals. ICE detains many immigrants living in the US with or without status who have children living in the US, some even natural-born citizens. The trauma of imprisonment of parents negatively affects the educational outcomes for these children; studies show that the children of an incarcerated parent are more likely to miss school, fail academically, or even drop out of high school.\nIn addition to the emotional effects of immigration detention, there are also economic effects of these practices that negatively impact the immigrant communities. The economic effects of immigrant detention are most apparent for those whom ICE detains long term (more than six months). A 2013 study surveyed over 500 immigrants detained over six months and revealed that at least 90% were employed prior to detention, equivalent to around a $21,000 deficit to the community per person detained every six months. Detention not only separates families, but it also often pulls the primary financial support provider out of the workforce, making the individual unable to provide for the rest of the family. The same study showed that at least nine out of ten of the people surveyed had families that relied on them for financial and emotional support. Detention needlessly pulls individuals away from their families and jobs, taking money out of the community and worsening the hardships of already marginalized groups.\nHealth care inside the facilities where ICE detains immigrants is often inadequate and sometimes fatal. In FY 2020, 21 individuals died in ICE custody. Though ICE contracts with facilities require them to provide adequate medical treatment, many facilities fall short of this requirement. Chronic illnesses, like diabetes and hypertension, are common and often ignored by staff; most complaints, no matter the severity, are treated only with ibuprofen and water. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, ICE facilities have failed to comply with the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) guidance and, in some cases, tried to prevent detainees from even learning about the pandemic on the news by changing the station on the television. There is no question that health care inside these facilities is inadequate, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only worsened the situation."

    "section": "Policy Alternatives",
    "text": "Policy Alternatives\nFor years, advocates for immigrant rights have been fighting for an end to immigrant detention. However, the US government has co-opted the phrase “Alternatives to Detention” to include electronic monitoring of immigrants through electronic ankle shackles, in-person check-ins, and home visits. This practice still restricts immigrants within the carceral system as they cannot freely move around without constant supervision and funds the same for-profit private prison corporations. This type of monitoring and control only increases the number of immigrants subject to punitive measures and government surveillance.\nElectronic monitoring may seem like a reasonable alternative to detention; however, it is truly part of the carceral system. Electronic shackles have been known to cause health issues and sometimes even electrocution. These shackles also bring with them a stigma that can make it hard for immigrants to find work or even be accepted in their communities due to the fear that they have committed crimes or that they may bring ICE to the community since ICE is constantly monitoring them. The same for-profit prison companies are responsible for supplying these ankle bracelets, so the same players continue to profit from electronically detaining immigrants.\nAnother alternative to detention is release on bond or parole. While this may sound like a reasonable alternative, ICE grants parole arbitrarily, and bonds are often too high for detained immigrants and their families to afford. The average bond for detained immigrants is $14,500, and there is no upper limit. High bonds also affect immigrants differently based on their race; Black immigrants must pay bonds that are, on average, 54 percent higher than the average immigration bond. Families and individuals that have traveled across multiple countries, leaving most of their belongings and assets behind for fear of their lives, often cannot afford these high bonds and thus must remain in detention indefinitely. Many advocate groups for immigrant rights have argued that immigrant detention must end in full, including the government’s “alternatives” to allow for a community-based system. Not only would this approach be much cheaper, but it is also more humane and gives immigrants dignity and a fighting chance to win their case. As one organization, Freedom for Immigrants, articulated in their report on alternatives to detention: “Rather than be incarcerated for months and years, immigrants arriving at the border would go through customs, receive screenings and assessments, a temporary ID, an immigration appointment and/or hearing date, and be assigned a community-based organization to help acclimate and/or guide them through the country’s immigration system and laws.” This approach would save taxpayer money, give immigrants access to the tools they need to fight a fair case, and uphold the dignity of all human life. It is important to remember that ICE has only existed for about two decades, and mandatory immigrant detention has been in practice for not much longer; immigrant detention is still a novel practice. For centuries, the US had managed immigration without the use of mass detention."

    "text": "Policy Recommendations\nMy policy recommendation would be to end the practice of immigrant detention; the US government must rethink and reinvest in a community-based system. Community-based alternatives are more humane, more effective, and less costly than detention. As an alternative to detention, community-based case management has a compliance rate of over 90 percent; that is, at least 90 percent of individuals appear for all their court dates and ICE check-ins. Studies show that when immigrants are treated with dignity and support, they will engage and comply with the proceedings required to maintain legal status in the US. The US government should stop detaining immigrants, both at the border and in the interior, and instead fund community organizations that offer case management for immigrants to ensure they stay in compliance with their proceedings."

    "text": "Prison Gerrymandering\nPrison gerrymandering is the practice of counting imprisoned people as residents of the place where they are imprisoned. The US Census defines residence as “where they live and sleep most of the time” [@uscensusbureau2020CensusResidence2018]. However, incarcerated people cannot vote or participate in the community where they are detained, and they often maintain ties to their community of origin and hope to have a future there when they return. The practice of counting these people as part of a community in which they have no role not only boosts representation for people around a prison but siphons resources and representation from their home communities [@benvenisteWhatPrisonGerrymandering2022]. The community conditions of places with high imprisonment rates are viewed as both the cause and the consequence of over-policing and disenfranchisement through the Prison Industrial Complex as it has expanded in the last several decades. As more people are pulled away from their homes and counted in a place that does not value their interests, the barriers to opportunity are reinforced, and the cycle of subjugation continues. If the true purpose of imprisonment is rehabilitation, and the hope upon release is to participate in society fully, the interests and opportunities of these individuals should be considered by policymakers who will impact their future opportunities for success.\nAs of 2021, about a dozen states had ended prison gerrymandering which would impact the redistricting from the 2020 Census [@fensterHowManyStates2021]. Because of the details involved with determining where and how to count these individuals in their home communities, data has been made available about precisely where people in prison are from, and where they intend to return to [@widraWherePeoplePrison2023]. This information is valuable and unique because it provides a link to determine the conditions that both create an environment where people feel the need to imprison larger portions of the population and create nuanced solutions to reduce both the harm that leads to imprisonment and the harm caused by it."

    "text": "Mental Health, Crime, and Imprisonment\nMental health care is an important resource to ensure overall health and quality of life [@princeNoHealthMental2007]. The expansion of mental health care in the last few decades has been a response to a dire crisis that has long been ignored and stigmatized, and the benefits of access and awareness of mental health services are obvious to many who have utilized these services [@hortonLaunchingNewMovement2007]. Though access to mental health services is generally regarded as a positive influence on communities, the marginalized groups who often lack access to these services are the same communities who are targeted for high crime and imprisonment rates [@saxenaResourcesMentalHealth2007]. The link between access to mental health care, crime, and imprisonment is worth investigating to advocate for more resources to be made available for these communities and potentially prevent crime and harm before they happen, and as a result, reduce unnecessary imprisonment.\nThree major components of mental health care and its relationship with imprisonment have been discussed. The first is mental health care as prevention of criminal and violent behavior [@hodginsConsequencesConductDisorder2005; @petrasDevelopmentalEpidemiologicalCourses2008; @brennanMajorMentalDisorders2000]. Increased access to mental health care, especially on a large scale could lead to an overall reduction in violent and aggressive behavior, which comprises most of the crime residents are most concerned about.\nThe second component is mental health care for the residents impacted by the loss of a loved one or caretaker to imprisonment. Many people in prison are parents or otherwise supportive to other that they leave behind to serve their sentence [@wangBothSidesBars2022]. The social and economic consequences of mass imprisonment are far-reaching, and the individuals living through those consequences would certainly benefit from a support structure that values their mental health [@hatzenbuehlerCollateralDamageMass2015; @nosratiEconomicDeclineIncarceration2019].\nLastly, prison can have a strong psychological impact on a person, and formerly imprisoned people may bring that trauma back to their communities when they are released. People in prison more likely to suffer from a mental health issue, both because, untreated, they are more likely to be arrested and because of the trauma endured throughout their sentence [@cloudLifeSupportPublic2014; @quandtResearchRoundupIncarceration2021]. The damage of imprisonment on mental health can include family disconnection, loss of autonomy and lack of purpose, and unpredictability [@quandtResearchRoundupIncarceration2021]. Accessibility to mental health care may influence productive reintegration after release from prison.\nWith the new information about the home locations of imprisoned people, there are a number of relationships to investigate. The obvious demographic and economic factors should be considered and potentially controlled in many analyses. One spatial relationship that could be investigated using this data is the accessibility, in terms of distance, to mental health facilities. While there are many dimensions to the concept of accessibility, distance can be a useful indicator of at least when mental health care options are not available. Other dimensions to consider are the capacity of facilities, specific services provided, populations served, payment methods accepted, and outreach or awareness of services available. This analysis focuses on the dimension of physical location and proximity as an indicator of access to mental health care, specifically inpatient care for emergency situations."

The Prison Policy Initiative collected, calculated, and combined this data for public use for various levels of geography for Maryland and eleven other states where prison gerrymandering has been overruled.\nMost of this data is from the 2020 Census. The imprisonment rate used the redistricting data from Maryland’s law ending prison gerrymandering to count prisoners as residents of their home neighborhoods instead of the location of the prison. The data was compiled using the data from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services which provided the home addresses of imprisoned people to redistricting officials to report them to the Census so they would be recorded in their home neighborhoods and not the prison’s location [@widraWherePeoplePrison2023; @RedistrictingData2020].\nThe original data had 1475 observations and the following 6 variables: FIPS code 2020, Maryland Census tracts, Number of people in state prison from each Census tract 2020, Census population 2020, Total population 2020, and Imprisonment rate per 100,000. The unit of observation for this analysis is the Census tract.\nThis data can be used to identify what characteristics are common among places with high imprisonment rates. Combined with demographic data about these locations and the proximity of mental health resources, this data can highlight areas in need of more mental health resources to reduce the harm caused by imprisonment and over-policing.\nThe original data is available from the Prison Policy Initiative website where the report was published. The census tract data for Maryland was copied into Excel, and the variables were renamed to be more usable in the analysis [@thejusticepolicyinstituteCensusTractAppendix2023]. The Prison Policy Initiative report provides thorough documentation of the data, its origins, and how it was processed. The variables have meaningful names, so there is no need for an official codebook.\nThe abolition of prison gerrymandering is still ongoing, so this data is only available in limited locations. However, it can be used to shed a light on the issue of prison gerrymandering and identify the common circumstances of places with high imprisonment rates."

As stated earlier, while this may not be enough to prove causation, it does describe the systematic ways that incarceration and the Prison Industrial Complex as a whole impact people of color and low-income communities disproportionately.\nThe data was originally downloaded from the US Census website as a compressed file with three CSV files [@CensusBureauData2020]. One file contained the data, another file contained the variable descriptions for each coded variable in the data file. The third file contained notes about the data and documentation about the methods used to collect and distribute the data.

Because this element was already processed and calculated, there are no missing values. Several outliers exist because of extremely low populations of several census tracts, the imprisonment of only one resident shows as a high proportion when normalized at a rate per 100,000 residents.\nThe US Census provides hundreds of attributes at the census tract level, however, these are often raw counts of individuals or households for each category. The estimates must be divided by the total counts to calculate the percentage of the population for each census tract for equal comparison. As with many large repositories of data, these datasets are missing some values for various variables. For the useful variables missing values, they are scarce and random; the values can easily be imputed for the important variables by finding the mean within the county of the tract. While outliers may exist in some categories, none were prominent in the variables selected for analysis. The values for each variable are numbers (with the exception of the geographic identifier and the name of the tract), however, they are not always stored as numbers and will need to be properly formatted.\nThe data about mental health facilities came from the National Directory of Mental Health Treatment Facilities 2020 as part of the Behavioral Health Services Information System Series [@samhsaNationalDirectoryMental2020].

The exception was for the Urban and Rural data because that was only available from 2010 which had less tracts than the 2020 data. The 2010 Urban and Rural census data was joined with 2010 census tract shapefiles in ArcGIS Pro. The spatial data was then apportioned to 2020 tracts based on the area of overlap and weighted by population.\nAfter merging the census data with the imprisonment data, the variables with relevant values were extracted to removed unneeded information regarding annotations and margins of error. The remaining variables were renamed with more meaningful names to better reflect the meaning of the values.\nThe merged data from the Prison Policy Initiative and the Census were joined to the ACS tracts in ArcGIS Pro for mapping. Several variables from ACS Context for Emergency Response were added to the merged dataset including percent less than 18 years old, percent 65 Years and over, percent in dependent age groups (under 18 and 65+), percent of households with no vehicle available, percent with a disability, percent with Medicaid coverage, percent with Medicare coverage, percent with no health insurance coverage, percent without a smart phone, and percent without internet access at home. The new variables were renamed with more meaningful names to better reflect the meaning of the values.\n\n\nMental Health Facilities\nAfter extraction from the directory, the dummy variables for mental health facilities in Maryland were renamed with meaningful names, and the addresses for each facility were geocoded in ArcGIS Pro. The geocoded facilities were also joined the newly merged data by spatial proximity. The distance to the closest mental health facility from the edge each tract was calculated in ArcGIS Pro in feet (as the crow flies) and then converted to miles. The dummy variables for the closest facility was also added to the dataset. This process was repeated for distance to the closest inpatient mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility providing crisis intervention, and the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins. Using ArcGIS, the total driving distance in miles and minutes was also calculated from the geographic center of each tract to the closest facility in each of these categories.\nThe complete dataset includes the imprisonment rate values from the Prison Policy Initiative, the selected attributes from the various Census and ACS tables, and the name, address, and dummy variables for the the closest mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility, the closest inpatient facility with crisis intervention, and the the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins, along with the linear distance, driving distance, and driving time to these facilities. These facility attributes were chosen because they represent opportunities for an alternative response to a dangerous situtation that may be better resolved with mental health treatment than law enforcement and imprisonment. If individuals who are imprisoned were able to access mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment if they may be a threat, in a time of crisis instead of being forced into the stressful and prejudiced criminal justice system, immediate and long term harm could be avoided."

The Black and White ratios were converted into majority dummy variables; the same was done for the homeownership and renters variables. The percent of the tract with a bachelor’s degree or higher, percent under poverty, and the unemployment rate were converted to variables to indicate if the value was above or below the mean. Each of these variables was also converted into categorical variables with descriptive labels.\nIn order to be able to perform analysis at the county level as well as the tract level, the county name was extracted from the tract name variable. The new variable would contain only the name of the county. Because of a formatting error with the apostrophes in some of the county names, some of the values needed to be manually cleaned in Excel."

Mental health accessibility is also important for formerly incarcerated people returning to their communities to heal from the trauma of imprisonment and become capable of reintegrating and supporting their community.\nWhile Baltimore has the highest concentration of imprisonment and proximity to inpatient mental health facilities, there are only four facilities in Baltimore city. Though the exact capacity of these facilities is unknown, the average inpatient capacity for inpatient facilities is [xxx], which is not likely to be sufficient to provide the necessary services for all those in Baltimore who would benefit. In addition to other barriers, such as health insurance coverage and transportation to facilities, more research is needed to assess the most effective expansion of service to target the neighborhood most in need.\n\n\n\n\nMap 2: Distance to Inpatient Facilities with Crisis Intervention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInpatient Accessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInpatient Accessibility: Excluding Baltimore City"

    "section": "Prison Gerrymandering",
    "text": "Prison Gerrymandering\nPrison gerrymandering is the practice of counting imprisoned people as residents of the place where they are imprisoned. The US Census defines residence as “where they live and sleep most of the time” (US Census Bureau, 2018). However, incarcerated people cannot vote or participate in the community where they are detained, and they often maintain ties to their community of origin and hope to have a future there when they return. The practice of counting these people as part of a community in which they have no role not only boosts representation for people around a prison but siphons resources and representation from their home communities (Benveniste, 2022). The community conditions of places with high imprisonment rates are viewed as both the cause and the consequence of over-policing and disenfranchisement through the Prison Industrial Complex as it has expanded in the last several decades. As more people are pulled away from their homes and counted in a place that does not value their interests, the barriers to opportunity are reinforced, and the cycle of subjugation continues. If the true purpose of imprisonment is rehabilitation, and the hope upon release is to participate in society fully, the interests and opportunities of these individuals should be considered by policymakers who will impact their future opportunities for success.\nAs of 2021, about a dozen states had ended prison gerrymandering which would impact the redistricting from the 2020 Census (Fenster, 2021). Because of the details involved with determining where and how to count these individuals in their home communities, data has been made available about precisely where people in prison are from, and where they intend to return to (Widra, 2023). This information is valuable and unique because it provides a link to determine the conditions that both create an environment where people feel the need to imprison larger portions of the population and create nuanced solutions to reduce both the harm that leads to imprisonment and the harm caused by it."

    "section": "Mental Health, Crime, and Imprisonment",
    "text": "Mental Health, Crime, and Imprisonment\nMental health care is an important resource to ensure overall health and quality of life (Prince et al., 2007). The expansion of mental health care in the last few decades has been a response to a dire crisis that has long been ignored and stigmatized, and the benefits of access and awareness of mental health services are obvious to many who have utilized these services (Horton, 2007). Though access to mental health services is generally regarded as a positive influence on communities, the marginalized groups who often lack access to these services are the same communities that are targeted for high crime and imprisonment rates (Saxena et al., 2007). The link between access to mental health care, crime, and imprisonment is worth investigating to advocate for more resources to be made available for these communities and potentially prevent crime and harm before they happen, and as a result, reduce unnecessary imprisonment.\nThree major components of mental health care and its relationship with imprisonment have been discussed. The first is mental health care as prevention of criminal and violent behavior (Brennan et al., 2000; Hodgins et al., 2005; Petras et al., 2008). Increased access to mental health care, especially on a large scale could lead to an overall reduction in violent and aggressive behavior, which comprises most of the crime residents are most concerned about.\nThe second component is mental health care for the residents impacted by the loss of a loved one or caretaker to imprisonment. Many people in prison are parents or otherwise supportive to other that they leave behind to serve their sentence (Wang, 2022). The social and economic consequences of mass imprisonment are far-reaching, and the individuals living through those consequences would certainly benefit from a support structure that values their mental health (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2015; Nosrati et al., 2019).\nLastly, prison can have a strong psychological impact on a person, and formerly imprisoned people may bring that trauma back to their communities when they are released. People in prison are more likely to suffer from a mental health issue, both because, untreated, they are more likely to be arrested and because of the trauma endured throughout their sentence (Cloud, 2014; Quandt & Jones, 2021). The damage of imprisonment on mental health can include family disconnection, loss of autonomy and lack of purpose, and unpredictability (Quandt & Jones, 2021). Accessibility to mental health care may influence productive reintegration after release from prison.\nWith the new information about the home locations of imprisoned people, there are a number of relationships to investigate. The obvious demographic and economic factors should be considered and potentially controlled in many analyses. One spatial relationship that could be investigated using this data is the accessibility, in terms of distance, to mental health facilities. While there are many dimensions to the concept of accessibility, distance can be a useful indicator of at least when mental health care options are not available. Other dimensions to consider are the capacity of facilities, specific services provided, populations served, payment methods accepted, and outreach or awareness of services available. This analysis focuses on the dimension of physical location and proximity as an indicator of access to mental health care, specifically inpatient care for emergency situations."

    "text": "Prison Policy Initiative\nThe data gathered from the Prison Policy Initiative is cross-sectional data based on data from the 2020 Census and Maryland state data. The data originated as administrative data from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and was combined with population data from the Census. The Prison Policy Initiative collected, calculated, and combined this data for public use for various levels of geography for Maryland and eleven other states where prison gerrymandering has been overruled.\nMost of this data is from the 2020 Census. The imprisonment rate used the redistricting data from Maryland’s law ending prison gerrymandering to count prisoners as residents of their home neighborhoods instead of the location of the prison. The data was compiled using the data from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services which provided the home addresses of imprisoned people to redistricting officials to report them to the Census so they would be recorded in their home neighborhoods and not the prison’s location (Redistricting Data, 2020; Widra, 2023).\nThe original data had 1475 observations and the following 6 variables: FIPS code 2020, Maryland Census tracts, Number of people in state prison from each Census tract 2020, Census population 2020, Total population 2020, and Imprisonment rate per 100,000. The unit of observation for this analysis is the Census tract.\nThis data can be used to identify what characteristics are common among places with high imprisonment rates. Combined with demographic data about these locations and the proximity of mental health resources, this data can highlight areas in need of more mental health resources to reduce the harm caused by imprisonment and over-policing.\nThe original data is available from the Prison Policy Initiative website where the report was published. The census tract data for Maryland was copied into Excel, and the variables were renamed to be more usable in the analysis (The Justice Policy Institute & Prison Policy Initiative, 2023). The Prison Policy Initiative report provides thorough documentation of the data, its origins, and how it was processed. The variables have meaningful names, so there is no need for an official codebook.\nThe abolition of prison gerrymandering is still ongoing, so this data is only available in limited locations. However, it can be used to shed a light on the issue of prison gerrymandering and identify the common circumstances of places with high imprisonment rates."

These included the following attributes: Employment (2020) with 1475 observations and 562 variables about employment rates; Geographic Mobility (2020) with 1475 observations and 1122 variables containing general demographic information about the population of each tract along with records of what types of people moved within and from outside the county, state, and country; Median Income (2020) with 1475 observations and 483 variables about the median income in each tract for different demographic groups; and Urban and Rural (2010) with 1406 observations and 9 variables contains the number of households in rural and urban areas.\nIn combination with the imprisonment data, the census data can show correlations between the racial and socioeconomic characteristics of an area and the rate of imprisonment. As stated earlier, while this may not be enough to prove causation, it does describe the systematic ways that incarceration and the Prison Industrial Complex as a whole impact people of color and low-income communities disproportionately.\nThe data was originally downloaded from the US Census website as a compressed file with three CSV files (Census Bureau Data, 2020). One file contained the data, another file contained the variable descriptions for each coded variable in the data file. The third file contained notes about the data and documentation about the methods used to collect and distribute the data. The US Census is a respected source for basic demographic information about each census tract. This is important to determine disparities in different areas that are linked to racial and socioeconomic status."

The data used for this specific analysis contains geographic and key characteristics of mental health facilities in Maryland. While some of these facilities also provide substance abuse treatment, facilities that exclusively provide substance abuse treatment are not included in this directory. The information about each facility is collected by a survey at the facility level; many data points are collected in the survey about specific treatments and capacities, but the information provided with geographic information in this directory only contained basic characteristics about the type of care, settings, operation, payments accepted, populations served, and others. Altogether, the National Directory of Mental Health Treatment Facilities 2020 provides a code for 103 different attributes for 235 facilities in Maryland (SAMHSA, 2020a).\nThe information is provided in a PDF available to download. Since the data is not available in a format that is easily analyzed, the information needed to be extracted and separated into a readable format for analysis. Each facility is listed with a name, address, and code for each attribute associated with that facility. The directory contains a key at the beginning to interpret each code.\nThe locations and services provided by each facility can demonstrate how access and proximity may be related to the rate of imprisonment in a community. People in jails and prisons are more likely than the general population to suffer from a serious mental health issue, and the carceral system does the bare minimum to provide resources and health care to these individuals while they are incarcerated, let alone before and after their imprisonment (Cloud, 2014). The availability of mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment for individuals who may be a risk to the community, as an alternative to imprisonment has more potential to increase public safety and the well-being of communities."

As part of the US Census, these data are available from the census bureau directly. However, for spatial analysis the ACS and Esri, a leader in geographic information system (GIS) software, host spatial data along with various attributes from the survey (Esri, 2020).\nThe Context for Emergency Response feature layer contains 1475 records for Maryland with 89 variables including the coordinates and shapes required to visually represent attributes geographically at the census tract level. Information about factors that relate to emergency response includes the amount of the population without health insurance, internet access at home, or a personal vehicle. The website hosting the data provides metadata and details about each variable available.\nWhile the importance of these data for this analysis is primarily spatial, the variables about some of these characteristics could be useful for further research to identify other relationships with imprisonment rates of different communities. The spatial data for the census tracts can also be used to determine the distance to different types of mental health facilities."

    "text": "The Raw Data\nWhen acquiring observational data collected by another organization, there are limitations on what is available. Often a dataset will include many additional variables in addition to the variables required to answer a research question.\nThe data from the Prison Policy Initiative was already normalized and estimated in relation to population data from the Census. Because this element was already processed and calculated, there are no missing values. Several outliers exist because of extremely low populations of several census tracts, the imprisonment of only one resident shows as a high proportion when normalized at a rate per 100,000 residents.\nThe US Census provides hundreds of attributes at the census tract level, however, these are often raw counts of individuals or households for each category. The estimates must be divided by the total counts to calculate the percentage of the population for each census tract for equal comparison. As with many large repositories of data, these datasets are missing some values for various variables. For the useful variables missing values, they are scarce and random; the values can easily be imputed for the important variables by finding the mean within the county of the tract. While outliers may exist in some categories, none were prominent in the variables selected for analysis. The values for each variable are numbers (with the exception of the geographic identifier and the name of the tract), however, they are not always stored as numbers and will need to be properly formatted.\nThe data about mental health facilities came from the National Directory of Mental Health Treatment Facilities 2020 as part of the Behavioral Health Services Information System Series (SAMHSA, 2020a). Since the data is in PDF format, the information needs to be extracted and parsed into an analytic format. Each facility name is accompanied by abbreviated codes that need to be converted into dummy variables. Since this is a comprehensive list of facilities, there are no missing values. The values for facility name and address are strings and do not need to be formatted; however, the address values will be used to obtain the geographic data about their locations on a map and in relation to each census tract.\nThe spatial data from the ACS is available from the Living Atlas with variables for both the raw counts and the percentages for each attribute as a feature layer for use in ArcGIS Pro (Living Atlas of the World, n.d.). The data did contain some missing values, but only in three observations and for variables not used for this analysis. Since the data came from a curated source, it was properly formatted as the appropriate data type for both spatial and quantitative analysis."

    "text": "Merging\n\nCensus Tracts\nThe imprisonment rate data was merged with several tables from the US Census. These were almost all an exact match because each census tract has a unique identifier to link it to the data from other datasets. The exception was for the Urban and Rural data because that was only available from 2010 which had fewer tracts than the 2020 data. The 2010 Urban and Rural census data was joined with 2010 census tract shapefiles in ArcGIS Pro. The spatial data was then apportioned to 2020 tracts based on the area of overlap and weighted by population.\nAfter merging the census data with the imprisonment data, the variables with relevant values were extracted to remove unneeded information regarding annotations and margins of error. The remaining variables were renamed with more meaningful names to better reflect the meaning of the values.\nThe merged data from the Prison Policy Initiative and the Census were joined to the ACS tracts in ArcGIS Pro for mapping. Several variables from ACS Context for Emergency Response were added to the merged dataset including percent less than 18 years old, percent 65 Years and over, percent in dependent age groups (under 18 and 65+), percent of households with no vehicle available, percent with a disability, percent with Medicaid coverage, percent with Medicare coverage, percent with no health insurance coverage, percent without a smartphone, and percent without internet access at home. The new variables were renamed with more meaningful names to better reflect the meaning of the values.\n\n\nMental Health Facilities\nAfter extraction from the directory, the dummy variables for mental health facilities in Maryland were renamed with meaningful names, and the addresses for each facility were geocoded in ArcGIS Pro. The geocoded facilities were also joined the newly merged data by spatial proximity. The distance to the closest mental health facility from the edge of each tract was calculated in ArcGIS Pro in feet (as the crow flies) and then converted to miles. The dummy variables for the closest facility were also added to the dataset. This process was repeated for distance to the closest inpatient mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility providing crisis intervention, and the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins. Using ArcGIS, the total driving distance in miles and minutes was also calculated from the geographic center of each tract to the closest facility in each of these categories.\nThe complete dataset includes the imprisonment rate values from the Prison Policy Initiative, the selected attributes from the various Census and ACS tables, and the name, address, and dummy variables for the closest mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility, the closest inpatient facility with crisis intervention, and the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins, along with the linear distance, driving distance, and driving time to these facilities. These facility attributes were chosen because they represent opportunities for an alternative response to a dangerous situation that may be better resolved with mental health treatment than law enforcement and imprisonment. If individuals who are imprisoned were able to access mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment if they may be a threat, in a time of crisis instead of being forced into the stressful and prejudiced criminal justice system, immediate and long-term harm could be avoided."

By visually analyzing the raw data, sanity checks, and validation, these issues were identified and resolved. In the imprisonment data, some of the total population values were miscalculated and were manually changed by adding the number of imprisoned individuals to the Census population values in Excel.\nCensus data contains many variables that describe both the attributes and the accuracy of the attribute’s values. Many of these attributes were removed altogether, and for others, only the annotation variables were removed, leaving only the relevant variables. Some of the relevant variables were formatted incorrectly and needed to be converted to a numeric format. Several variables contained missing values, and these were imputed with the mean value of that variable for the tract’s county. The observations with imputed values are identifiable through a new variable indicating whether they had missing values. The last issue with these data was outliers. Because the imprisonment rate is calculated per 100,000 residents, census tracts with extremely low populations may have an extremely high imprisonment rate, even if only one person is from that tract. To resolve this issue, all tracts with less than 100 total population were excluded. Most of these tracts also had very little land area, and their absence should not impact the results. Three additional tracts were dropped due to missing values for several variables. The three tracts were missing values because they are tracts that only contain corrections facilities, the Baltimore jail, the Maryland correctional training center, and the Maryland state prison\nThe ACS data also contained some missing values.

The Black and White ratios were converted into majority dummy variables; the same was done for the homeownership and renters variables. The percent of the tract with a bachelor’s degree or higher, percent under poverty, and the unemployment rate were converted to variables to indicate if the value was above or below the mean. Each of these variables was also converted into categorical variables with descriptive labels.\nIn order to be able to perform analysis at the county level as well as the tract level, the county name was extracted from the tract name variable. The new variable would contain only the name of the county. Because of a formatting error with the apostrophes in some of the county names, some of the values needed to be manually cleaned in Excel."

The map of imprisonment rates in Maryland, shown in Figure 1, highlights the concentration of high imprisonment in the Baltimore urban area. Since Baltimore is the largest urban area entirely in Maryland, it is not unexpected to see higher rates of imprisonment in the city and surrounding areas. However, the suburbs of Washington, D.C. are also partially in Maryland with comparable population density, but the imprisonment rate for those areas are much lower than the Baltimore suburbs. Though rural areas outside of the two major metropolitan areas seem to have lower rates of imprisonment overall, the southeast peninsula and northwest panhandle seem to have surprisingly higher rates. From this map, it seems that these areas are further from inpatient facilities, and the few in those areas may not have sufficient capacity for the large areas they serve.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of Imprisonment Rate by Race\n\n\n\n\n\nAn initial overall look at the distribution of the tracts and imprisonment rate shows clear and obvious characteristics related to higher rates is race. Figure 2 clearly shows that census tracts that have a majority Black population have, on average, much higher rates of imprisonment. Tracts with less than a majority Black population had an average imprisonment rate of 162, and majority Black tracts had an average of 162, or 574 higher than their counterparts. While majority Black tracts had over 100 tracts with an imprisonment rate above 1,000 per 100,000 people, tracts without a majority Black population had only eight above 1,000 per 100,000 people, of which half were majority White (see Table 4).\n\n\n\n\nTable 4:  Census Tracts Not Majority Black and Over 1000 Imprisoned per 100,000 \n \n  \n    FIPS \n    Tract \n    Imprisonment Rate \n    % White \n    % Black \n  \n \n\n  \n    24043000400 \n    Washington County, Census Tract 4 \n    1743 \n    48.5 \n    45.9 \n  \n  \n    24510250401 \n    Baltimore City, Census Tract 2504.01 \n    1263 \n    57.7 \n    29.2 \n  \n  \n    24510250303 \n    Baltimore City, Census Tract 2503.03 \n    1168 \n    63.8 \n    23.5 \n  \n  \n    24510260404 \n    Baltimore City, Census Tract 2604.04 \n    1139 \n    48.8 \n    13.1 \n  \n  \n    24510250500 \n    Baltimore City, Census Tract 2505 \n    1115 \n    48.4 \n    40.5 \n  \n  \n    24510060300 \n    Baltimore City, Census Tract 603 \n    1096 \n    55.2 \n    37.8 \n  \n  \n    24510060200 \n    Baltimore City, Census Tract 602 \n    1030 \n    43.6 \n    48.8 \n  \n  \n    24510030200 \n    Baltimore City, Census Tract 302 \n    1009 \n    61.4 \n    26.6 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5:  Imprisonment and Key Characteristics: Maryland \n \n  \n      \n    Model 1 \n     Model 2 \n     Model 3 \n    All \n  \n \n\n  \n    (Intercept) \n    880.88*** \n    13.92 \n    465.84*** \n    260.55*** \n  \n  \n     \n    (32.80) \n    (0.91) \n    (14.67) \n    (7.13) \n  \n  \n    Median Income \n    −6.19*** \n     \n    −4.09*** \n    −2.09*** \n  \n  \n     \n    (−23.42) \n     \n    (−15.88) \n    (−6.11) \n  \n  \n    % Black \n     \n    9.19*** \n    6.91*** \n    5.20*** \n  \n  \n     \n     \n    (26.69) \n    (19.79) \n    (14.72) \n  \n  \n    % w/ Degree \n     \n     \n     \n    −2.87*** \n  \n  \n     \n     \n     \n     \n    (−4.21) \n  \n  \n    Unemployment \n     \n     \n     \n    34.82*** \n  \n  \n     \n     \n     \n     \n    (12.17) \n  \n  \n    N \n    1455 \n    1455 \n    1455 \n    1455 \n  \n\n\nNote:   t statistics in parentheses  (+ p < 0.1, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001)\n\n\n\n\n\nExpectedly, the common indicators of inequality have a significant relationship with imprisonment rates. Median income, percentage of Black people in the population, percentage of the population with at least a bachelor’s degree, and the unemployment rate are all strongly and significantly related to high imprisonment. As educational attainment and income rise, the expected imprisonment rate falls, and as the percentage of the population that is Black and the unemployment rate rises, so does the expected imprisonment rate. Even when controlling for all of these factors, each has a significant correlation with the rate of imprisonment (see Table 5).\n\n\n\n\nTable 6:  Imprisonment and Key Characteristics: Rural Maryland \n \n  \n      \n    Model 1 \n     Model 2 \n     Model 3 \n    All \n  \n \n\n  \n    (Intercept) \n    397.50*** \n    122.19*** \n    365.85*** \n    295.14*** \n  \n  \n     \n    (21.68) \n    (13.23) \n    (19.85) \n    (12.76) \n  \n  \n    Median Income \n    −2.39*** \n     \n    −2.36*** \n    −1.31*** \n  \n  \n     \n    (−14.19) \n     \n    (−14.53) \n    (−5.02) \n  \n  \n    % Black \n     \n    1.86*** \n    1.74*** \n    1.46*** \n  \n  \n     \n     \n    (5.36) \n    (6.03) \n    (5.19) \n  \n  \n    % w/ Degree \n     \n     \n     \n    −2.13*** \n  \n  \n     \n     \n     \n     \n    (−3.74) \n  \n  \n    Unemployment \n     \n     \n     \n    11.21*** \n  \n  \n     \n     \n     \n     \n    (5.05) \n  \n  \n    N \n    467 \n    467 \n    467 \n    467 \n  \n\n\nNote:   t statistics in parentheses  (+ p < 0.1, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001)\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Maryland does contain at least part of two major metropolitan areas, separating out the rural areas can provide insights into how relationships might change outside the city and how to plan and implement policies that target the needs of that type of community. However, Table 6 shows that the same tract characteristics are still significantly related to imprisonment rates, but with slightly lower numbers.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7:  Distance to Mental Health Facilities (in Miles) \n \n  \n      \n    All Maryland \n    Rural Model 1 \n     Rural Model 2 \n     Rural Model 3 \n     Rural Model 4 \n    All Rural Models \n  \n \n\n  \n    (Intercept) \n    458.54*** \n    175.06*** \n    121.96*** \n    77.84*** \n    97.47*** \n    112.57*** \n  \n  \n     \n    (23.91) \n    (15.55) \n    (10.09) \n    (8.79) \n    (10.88) \n    (9.88) \n  \n  \n    Mental Health Facility \n    −10.50*** \n    −2.60** \n     \n     \n     \n    −4.47*** \n  \n  \n     \n    (−3.50) \n    (−2.61) \n     \n     \n     \n    (−3.92) \n  \n  \n    Inpatient Facility \n    −13.51*** \n     \n    1.88** \n     \n     \n    −0.22 \n  \n  \n     \n    (−7.36) \n     \n    (3.23) \n     \n     \n    (−0.31) \n  \n  \n    Inpatient with Crisis Intervention \n    0.62 \n     \n     \n    2.50*** \n     \n    2.04*** \n  \n  \n     \n    (0.57) \n     \n     \n    (12.42) \n     \n    (5.28) \n  \n  \n    Inpatient accepting Walk-ins \n    2.12+ \n     \n     \n     \n    1.99*** \n    0.74* \n  \n  \n     \n    (1.90) \n     \n     \n     \n    (9.55) \n    (2.00) \n  \n  \n    N \n    1455 \n    467 \n    467 \n    467 \n    467 \n    467 \n  \n\n\nNote:   t statistics in parentheses  (+ p < 0.1, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crucial addition to this collection of census tract characteristics is the proximity to mental health facilities. As discussed earlier, access to mental health care, and specifically inpatient care when someone is in crisis, is not only an alternative to imprisonment, it may even prevent future harm and repair issues that can lead to criminal behavior. Table 7 shows little or even the opposite effect overall, but by isolating rural areas the relationship between distance and imprisonment is significant and positive, especially for inpatient facilities with crisis intervention or accepting walk-ins.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8:  All Models \n \n  \n      \n    Maryland \n    Rural \n    Distance \n    Distance Rural \n    All Factors \n    All Rural \n  \n \n\n  \n    (Intercept) \n    260.55*** \n    295.14*** \n    458.54*** \n    112.57*** \n    371.35*** \n    252.24*** \n  \n  \n     \n    (7.13) \n    (12.76) \n    (23.91) \n    (9.88) \n    (9.22) \n    (9.39) \n  \n  \n    Median Income \n    −2.09*** \n    −1.31*** \n     \n     \n    −2.05*** \n    −0.86*** \n  \n  \n     \n    (−6.11) \n    (−5.02) \n     \n     \n    (−6.05) \n    (−3.37) \n  \n  \n    % Black \n    5.20*** \n    1.46*** \n     \n     \n    5.27*** \n    1.34*** \n  \n  \n     \n    (14.72) \n    (5.19) \n     \n     \n    (14.43) \n    (4.98) \n  \n  \n    % w/ Degree \n    −2.87*** \n    −2.13*** \n     \n     \n    −3.23*** \n    −2.34*** \n  \n  \n     \n    (−4.21) \n    (−3.74) \n     \n     \n    (−4.71) \n    (−4.44) \n  \n  \n    Unemployment \n    34.82*** \n    11.21*** \n     \n     \n    32.29*** \n    8.88*** \n  \n  \n     \n    (12.17) \n    (5.05) \n     \n     \n    (11.63) \n    (4.24) \n  \n  \n    Mental Health Distance \n     \n     \n    −10.50*** \n    −4.47*** \n    8.97*** \n    −2.75** \n  \n  \n     \n     \n     \n    (−3.50) \n    (−3.92) \n    (3.88) \n    (−2.73) \n  \n  \n    Inpatient Distance \n     \n     \n    −13.51*** \n    −0.22 \n    −13.69*** \n    −0.51 \n  \n  \n     \n     \n     \n    (−7.36) \n    (−0.31) \n    (−10.32) \n    (−0.86) \n  \n  \n    Inpatient with Crisis Intervention Distance \n     \n     \n    0.62 \n    2.04*** \n    3.66*** \n    2.05*** \n  \n  \n     \n     \n     \n    (0.57) \n    (5.28) \n    (4.58) \n    (6.29) \n  \n  \n    Inpatient accepting Walk-ins Distance \n     \n     \n    2.12+ \n    0.74* \n    −2.45** \n    −0.48 \n  \n  \n     \n     \n     \n    (1.90) \n    (2.00) \n    (−3.00) \n    (−1.46) \n  \n  \n    N \n    1455 \n    467 \n    1455 \n    467 \n    1455 \n    467 \n  \n\n\nNote:   t statistics in parentheses  (+ p < 0.1, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001)\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at all the models side-by-side in Table 8, even controlling for the tract characteristics from Table 5 and Table 6, distance to facilities with crisis intervention has a significant relationship with imprisonment. Without accessibility to emergency mental health treatment, people in crisis are more likely to end up arrested, or worse, if police are the only option to de-escalate the situation.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Distance to Crisis Intervention from Rural Tracts\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause urban tracts are overrepresented and more likely to be spatially close to a facility, the relationship is not clear, However, this does not account for capacity at urban facilities. According to the National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS): 2020, the average capacity of facilities across Maryland is 44 beds for inpatient clients (slightly lower than the national average of 49) (SAMHSA, 2020b). Even assuming the facilities in Baltimore have a higher capacity than average, it is unlikely the four inpatient facilities within Baltimore City are equipped to adequately provide care to the city’s nearly half a million population. The map from Figure 1 highlights that Baltimore has the highest concentration of high imprisonment rates in Maryland, but few facilities offering inpatient care for a large and densely populated area."

Race and income also have a strong relationship with each other. Figure 4 visualizes the relationship between income, race, and imprisonment; the vertical and horizontal lines indicate the median income and average imprisonment for tracts with a majority Black population and those without a majority (though not necessarily a majority White population). Almost all the tracts below the median income for tracts with a Black majority are above average for imprisonment. It is also notable that the median and mean for these variables are quite different for each group. Not only is the racial income disparity obvious, but that disparity can lead to higher rates of imprisonment, adding a huge obstacle to economic success in already struggling communities.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Imprisonment Rates and Black Communities\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile proximity to mental health care appears to be a bigger issue for rural areas, which may still be low-income but less likely to have a majority of Black residents, imprisonment is still an important issue in these communities. Especially in the Baltimore area, the percentage of Black residents is highly associated with high imprisonment. Figure 5 zooms in on two areas of Maryland with a high concentration of Black communities, the Washington D.C. suburbs and the Baltimore urban area. The darkest colors on the map indicate a high percentage of Black population and high imprisonment; the bright colors indicate that one is high but the other is low; the lightest colors indicate that both are low. In the D.C. suburbs there are some pockets that have high imprisonment, but many tracks with large Black populations, but relatively low imprisonment. However, in Baltimore, almost the entire area is high in both measures. It is worth investigating reasons the DC suburbs are not experiencing the level of imprisonment as in and around Baltimore, but that is outside the scope of this research."

    "text": "Access to Mental Health Care\nWhile Baltimore has the highest concentration of imprisonment, its tracts also have proximity to inpatient mental health facilities. However, there are only four facilities in Baltimore city. Though the exact capacity of these facilities is unknown, the average inpatient capacity for inpatient facilities in Maryland is, at most, 87 (or 25 excluding the only three facilities with a capacity of at least 100) (SAMHSA, 2020b). The Baltimore area has over two million residents, and it is not likely that four facilities are sufficient to provide the necessary services for all those in need of care. In addition to other barriers, such as health insurance coverage and transportation to facilities, more research is needed to assess the most effective expansion of service to target the communities most in need.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Distance to Inpatient Facilities with Crisis Intervention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Inpatient Accessibility\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside urban areas, distance to inpatient mental health facilities is significantly associated with imprisonment rates. Figure 6 shows the areas of Maryland with long travel times to inpatient facilities with crisis intervention and high imprisonment rates. As expected and explained earlier, the urban areas may be close and still have high imprisonment rates. But the southeast area has high travel times and high imprisonment but is not near a major city. This is an area where proximity is likely to play a larger role in accessibility and would be an area worth investing in more mental health resources. Figure 7 plots the relationship between driving distance and imprisonment rate; the lighter lines indicate the means for tracts that are not majority White (the diamond points), and the darker lines indicate means for tracts with a majority White population (circle points). In rural tracts, proximity to inpatient care seems to lower imprisonment rates for non-majority white communities.\nProximity to mental health care can not only prevent harmful criminal behavior, but it can also serve as an alternative for dangerous situations before they become criminal actions. Untreated mental health issues can put someone in a crisis, and without the tools to respond to that crisis, the person suffering and others can be in danger. If the only resource available is the police, who may not even be trained or equipped to confront a person experiencing a mental health crisis, there is a higher chance that the situation will either harm the person in crisis, others, or both. No one calls an electrician when a toilet overflows, why would you want to call the police when you need a doctor? Either no one is called and the person may become desperate and turn to illegal activity, or the police are called and unable to de-escalate the situation resulting in arrest, incarceration, or even death.\nMental health accessibility is also important for formerly incarcerated people returning to their communities to heal from the trauma of imprisonment and become capable of reintegrating and supporting their community. Prison is a traumatizing place, and some people spend many years locked up for minor, non-violent offenses but endure years of violence and trauma from other inmates and staff, and they may be more in need of mental health care than ever before. Communities experiencing high rates of imprisonment need investment in mental health, not only for prevention, but for rehabilitation as well."

Several of these outcomes have begun to garner attention from advocates publishing data on changes after these reforms (Heaton, 2022; Widra, 2022). Some of these outcomes are broad and difficult to measure, but inequality in the justice system can be measured in part by assessing disparities around racial identity and socioeconomic status in who chooses to accept a guilty plea deal and whether detained defendants are more likely to be convicted or receive longer sentences. Administrative data is available for both the bond amount and the outcome of the charges for both before and after the reform was implemented along with demographic attributes."

    "text": "Measuring Increased Equality in the Justice System\nTo measure equality in the justice system, economic and racial disparities must be considered. An obvious place to start might be with the rate of arrests, convictions, and sentencing across individuals with different economic and racial backgrounds because this could illuminate clear patterns of discrimination inherent in the system. However, the inequality on the part of law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, and laws has been well documented and reported on and does not necessarily correlate directly with the affordability of bail (Gase et al., 2016; Mitchell & MacKenzie, 2004; Racial Disparities in Sentencing, 2022; Threadgill et al., 2022).\nMany individuals have stated that they chose to agree to a plea deal because they could not afford bail and the alternative was to wait in jail for a court appearance (Subramanian et al., 2020). If the cost of bail was no longer an obstacle, the rate of individuals accepting plea deals should decrease because innocent people would not normally agree to a guilty plea without the coercion of pretrial detention.\nThe conviction rates for detained and released defendants are also measurable, and it is a good indicator of to what degree there is an advantage of not being detained when appearing in court (Dobbie et al., 2018; Gius, 2018). Individuals are to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, but appearing in court in a jumpsuit and shackles can give the impression of guilt even for innocent defendants. If bail reform allows people to be released from jail while they await trial, it follows that the implicit bias that leads to a higher conviction for detained defendants would be alleviated. While the rate of conviction for detained defendants may not be impacted for defendants who are not eligible for release at all, it would remove the economic barrier for many to have a chance of a fair hearing.\n\nRate of accepting guilty plea deals\n\nMeasurable definition: Rate of individuals agreeing to plea deals after arrest.\nIdeal measurement: Collecting information from every arrestee about their reason for accepting or rejecting a plea deal.\nFeasible measurement: By comparing the type of crime the individual is charged with, their criminal history, and the amount of time they were detained pretrial, there may be an indication that pretrial detention increases the likelihood of accepting a plea deal, especially when the pretrial time period longer.\nMeasurement of program effect: If individuals are less likely to accept a plea deal after release from detention, it may conclude that release from detention was a primary reason for considering a plea deal.\n\n\n\nConviction rates\n\nMeasurable definition: Appearing before the court as a non-detained defendant impacts the rate of conviction.\nIdeal measurement: Collect information regarding the detention status of defendants in court and how it correlates with conviction rates.\nFeasible measurement: In this case, the ideal measurement is available from the court records.\nMeasurement of program effect: Bail reform allows most people arrested for a misdemeanor to be released from detention and return to the court for their next court date. If the rate of conviction is lower for non-detained defendants, this provides evidence that individuals are given more equitable proceedings when they are not brought to court directly from the jail."

    "text": "Causal theory\nGiven your measurement approach, describe and draw a causal diagram (DAG) that shows how your program causes the outcome. Note that this is not the same thing as the logic model—you’ll likely have nodes in the DAG that aren’t related to the program at all (like socioeconomic status, gender, experience, or other factors). The logic model provides the framework for the actual implementation of your program and connects all the moving parts to the outcomes. The DAG is how you can prove causation with statistical approaches. (≈150 words)\n\n\n\n\nDiff-in-diff DAG\n\n\n\n\n\nMy claim is that bail reform, or elimination of cash bail for misdemeanors, would reduce the number of plea deals that defendants agree to take. The cash bail system requires arrestees to pay a court ordered amount of money in order to be released from jail while awaiting trial. However, many individuals who cannot afford to pay must remain in custody until trial. There is logical and empirical evidence that individuals who can not afford to pay bail agree to plea deals regardless of guilt simply to be released from detention (Subramanian et al., 2020). Detaining individuals simply on the basis of their inability to pay before they are ever convicted of a crime leads innocent people to accept guilty pleas to avoid additional time away from their families and livelihoods. Based on this logic, it seems plausible that eliminating cash bail would cause less people to choose to accept a guilty plea since they can go about their lives while they await the opportunity to prove their innocence.\nThere are many factors that influence both bail, of the affordability of bail, and plea deals, or both. Criminal record and the particular presiding judge may influence whether or how high bail is set; socioeconomic status (SES) also influences whether the amount is affordable or even the amount itself. The prosecutor may influence the judge, and white supremacy and racism may influence both the judge and the prosecutor. Independently, the evidence of guilt, or lack thereof, may impact the prosecutor’s decision on both the request for bail or a plea deal. The affordability of bail directly impacts the length of time someone is detained, but the length of detention for an individual awaiting trial is also determined by state resources to manage criminal cases. State resources also influence jail conditions, and both jail conditions and the length of detention can impact someone’s decision to accept a plea deal to expedite their release. The last factor included is dependents, and this is used as a catch-all variable for dependent family members, job responsibilities and status, and anything or anyone else who might be depending on the arrestee. Dependents can influence the affordability of bail and the acceptance of plea deal to reduce the amount of time away from dependents.\nThough both racism and evidence of guilt are not directly measurable, their paths can be blocked off by adjusting for prosecutor or judge and SES. By controlling for either prosecutor or judge and SES, the backdoor linking bail and plea deals is closed. State resources is another unobservable, or difficult to measure, variable, but it only impacts detention length and conditions which do not impact the affordability of bail. Dependents directly impact the affordability of bail and the attractiveness of a plea deal to secure release from detention and must be controlled for to see the total impact of bail affordability and the number of plea deals accepted."

It is also likely that the overall rate of conviction will decrease if defendants are released pretrial and are more able to seek legal counsel and retain their employment status. Even where convictions still occur, sentencing should be impacted as more defendants are able to prepare and present in court in their own clothes and with the support of their families and communities instead of in shackles and a jumpsuit with limited access to legal and emotional resources."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A term as common as the word “civilization” can have many meanings and many connotations depending on the context in which it is used. Generally used to represent what the modern era calls “Western” civilization as a descendant of European colonialism and hegemony, it brings with it a condescending view of the so-called uncivilized, or “savage” people of the world. If civilization does equal the European, colonial, and often Christian, Western civilization, then if an “uncivilized” people adopt this definition of civilization for themselves, they too would be civilized and therefore equal and independent. According to his writings and speeches Elias Boudinot rhetoric supported this logic, born into the Cherokee Nation and educated in a New England mission school, who returned to establish the first Native American newspaper with the explicit aim to benefit the Cherokee Nation and prove its desire for, and accomplishments, of “civilization.”1 Through his public speeches and the publication of the Cherokee Phoenix, Elias Boudinot helped shape an identity of Cherokee people and the concept of “civilization” as it was understood both by Cherokees and white Americans, specifically southerners. Boudinot and other Cherokees understood civilization as a means to sovereignty and land retention, while white southerners strived to use their own understanding of civilization, fueled by white supremacy, for social and political hegemony and justification of acculturation and eventual Removal.\nFrom a white American perspective, civilization equals sovereignty; the United States, a civilized, sovereign nation, declared independence from England and with official treaties between two civilized nations became legally independent with one no longer subject to the other’s rule. Because both the established colonies and England were equal in their status of civilization and race, one having derived from the other, as a result of the Revolutionary War, there is no dispute in the agreement to be separate and sovereign. A complication arose when Elias Boudinot’s own writing seemed to support the perceived superiority of Western civilization and adopted its traditions. He had a strong desire to foster and encourage the adaptation of this manner of civilization within the Cherokee Nation and prove the capability of Indians to be civilized and equal to their white neighbors, and therefore also sovereign and independent in their own right.2 If Cherokees, and other Indians, were equally capable of civilization, within the same terms of Western civilization, it would follow, within that same doctrine, that to deny legitimate sovereignty to the Cherokee Nation would be immoral.\nThe southeastern corner of the new United States in the early 19th century was emerging with a conflict of identities. The plantation economy, supported by the enslavement of Africans and the culture of cotton, encouraged the disparity between rich and poor, white and black, while establishing a southern prosperity and promise of upward mobility for the white southern Americans enjoying prosperity in their new nation. This new southern identity left out or overpowered the conflicting struggles in the South of both enslaved black people and Indians surviving in the region within what came to be known as the “Five Civilized Tribes” (Creek, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Cherokee, and Seminole). In 1825, the Cherokee Nation established its new capitol at New Echota (near present day Calhoun, GA).3 The name “New Echota” means the “place where we will strike the new fire” in Cherokee. The town was built and designed in the colonial style, adopting European architecture, economics, and style into Cherokee tradition. Along with the national debate regarding the removal of Indians west of the Mississippi River, New Echota emerged within the climate of state nullification in the South, in which some southern states were attempting to nullify federal law that they deemed unconstitutional. Cherokee leaders in New Echota were establishing their own hybrid culture and different stances on these issues. Elias Boudinot was among these leaders; to be civilized and also be Indian, he used both his background of a New England education and his Cherokee heritage to shape the ensuing debate among Cherokees and with their ever-encroaching white neighbors."

    "title": "Ending Immigrant Detention in the United States",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States detains more immigrants than any other country in the world. The US government, specifically Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), uses largely private prison institutions to lock up immigrants for indefinite amounts of time for a profit (Detention Watch Network, 2022b). The government denies detained immigrants access to court-appointed legal counsel and many other rights afforded to incarcerated US citizens. Because many of these prisons are private, for-profit institutions, conditions are often inhumane—lack of medical care is rampant; sexual, physical, and verbal abuse is common; and ICE often separates families with no meaningful way to communicate (Detention Watch Network, 2022b). There are two types of immigrant detention: those whom Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) detain at the border, often asylum seekers, and those whom ICE detains while living in the US due to being undocumented, missing a hearing or ICE check-in, or breaking the law. Immigrant detention harms many aspects of US society, including education, the economy, and healthcare. The implications of these policies harm the individuals detained and their families and communities across the nation. Though there have been some efforts to release some immigrants through parole, bond, and electronic monitoring, none of these solutions are as effective or equitable as community-based alternatives. Community-based alternatives are the best way forward. Community-based systems engage immigrants in the process and treat them with dignity while they pursue their new life in the US.\n\n\nProblem Significance\nImmigration is a crucial part of the US’s history and identity; immigrants have been coming to the US since before it was founded and have shaped the nation’s identity. However, more and more, these individuals, mostly asylum seekers and survivors of torture, are mistreated and detained without due process, legal counsel, or access to basic human needs. Tens of thousands of immigrants are detained every day in the US, some for months or even years at a time. The US government detained over 500,000 immigrants in the Fiscal Year 2019 (Detention Watch Network, 2022b). Many must fight their entire immigration case and the threat of deportation from these detention centers. If they are lucky enough to afford an attorney or are detained somewhere where pro bono attorneys can assist them in detention, they may have a chance to win their freedom and fight their case outside of detention. However, arbitrarily high bonds and bond denials are common barriers to their freedom. The immigration process, like many other legal processes, is complicated and arduous; without access to legal counsel, it is nearly impossible to navigate it. Access to counsel issues are all too common, especially in ICE detention centers (Freedom for Immigrants, 2022c).\nThe detention of immigrants does not only affect those detained; it also negatively affects the family members of detained individuals. ICE detains many immigrants living in the US with or without status who have children living in the US, some even natural-born citizens. The trauma of imprisonment of parents negatively affects the educational outcomes for these children; studies show that the children of an incarcerated parent are more likely to miss school, fail academically, or even drop out of high school (Gonzalez & Patler, 2021).\nIn addition to the emotional effects of immigration detention, there are also economic effects of these practices that negatively impact the immigrant communities. The economic effects of immigrant detention are most apparent for those whom ICE detains long term (more than six months). A 2013 study surveyed over 500 immigrants detained over six months and revealed that at least 90% were employed prior to detention, equivalent to around a $21,000 deficit to the community per person detained every six months (Patler, 2013). Detention not only separates families, but it also often pulls the primary financial support provider out of the workforce, making the individual unable to provide for the rest of the family. The same study showed that at least nine out of ten of the people surveyed had families that relied on them for financial and emotional support (Patler, 2013). Detention needlessly pulls individuals away from their families and jobs, taking money out of the community and worsening the hardships of already marginalized groups.\nHealth care inside the facilities where ICE detains immigrants is often inadequate and sometimes fatal. In FY 2020, 21 individuals died in ICE custody (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 2022). Though ICE contracts with facilities require them to provide adequate medical treatment, many facilities fall short of this requirement. Chronic illnesses, like diabetes and hypertension, are common and often ignored by staff; most complaints, no matter the severity, are treated only with ibuprofen and water (Hyunhye Cho & Shah, 2016). Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, ICE facilities have failed to comply with the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) guidance and, in some cases, tried to prevent detainees from even learning about the pandemic on the news by changing the station on the television (Peeler et al., 2021). There is no question that health care inside these facilities is inadequate, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only worsened the situation.\n\n\nPolicy Alternatives\nFor years, advocates for immigrant rights have been fighting for an end to immigrant detention. However, the US government has co-opted the phrase “Alternatives to Detention” to include electronic monitoring of immigrants through electronic ankle shackles, in-person check-ins, and home visits (Detention Watch Network, 2022a). This practice still restricts immigrants within the carceral system as they cannot freely move around without constant supervision and funds the same for-profit private prison corporations (Freedom for Immigrants, 2022a). This type of monitoring and control only increases the number of immigrants subject to punitive measures and government surveillance (Detention Watch Network, 2022a).\nElectronic monitoring may seem like a reasonable alternative to detention; however, it is truly part of the carceral system. Electronic shackles have been known to cause health issues and sometimes even electrocution (RAICES, 2022). These shackles also bring with them a stigma that can make it hard for immigrants to find work or even be accepted in their communities due to the fear that they have committed crimes or that they may bring ICE to the community since ICE is constantly monitoring them (RAICES, 2022). The same for-profit prison companies are responsible for supplying these ankle bracelets, so the same players continue to profit from electronically detaining immigrants.\nAnother alternative to detention is release on bond or parole. While this may sound like a reasonable alternative, ICE grants parole arbitrarily, and bonds are often too high for detained immigrants and their families to afford. The average bond for detained immigrants is $14,500, and there is no upper limit (Freedom for Immigrants, 2022b). High bonds also affect immigrants differently based on their race; Black immigrants must pay bonds that are, on average, 54 percent higher than the average immigration bond (RAICES, 2020). Families and individuals that have traveled across multiple countries, leaving most of their belongings and assets behind for fear of their lives, often cannot afford these high bonds and thus must remain in detention indefinitely.\nMany advocate groups for immigrant rights have argued that immigrant detention must end in full, including the government’s “alternatives” to allow for a community-based system. Not only would this approach be much cheaper, but it is also more humane and gives immigrants dignity and a fighting chance to win their case. As one organization, Freedom for Immigrants, articulated in their report on alternatives to detention: “Rather than be incarcerated for months and years, immigrants arriving at the border would go through customs, receive screenings and assessments, a temporary ID, an immigration appointment and/or hearing date, and be assigned a community-based organization to help acclimate and/or guide them through the country’s immigration system and laws” (Human Rights Watch, 2021). This approach would save taxpayer money, give immigrants access to the tools they need to fight a fair case, and uphold the dignity of all human life. It is important to remember that ICE has only existed for about two decades, and mandatory immigrant detention has been in practice for not much longer; immigrant detention is still a novel practice. For centuries, the US had managed immigration without the use of mass detention.\n\n\nPolicy Recommendations\nMy policy recommendation would be to end the practice of immigrant detention; the US government must rethink and reinvest in a community-based system. Community-based alternatives are more humane, more effective, and less costly than detention (Human Rights Watch, 2021). As an alternative to detention, community-based case management has a compliance rate of over 90 percent; that is, at least 90 percent of individuals appear for all their court dates and ICE check-ins (Secor et al., 2019). Studies show that when immigrants are treated with dignity and support, they will engage and comply with the proceedings required to maintain legal status in the US (Secor et al., 2019). The US government should stop detaining immigrants, both at the border and in the interior, and instead fund community organizations that offer case management for immigrants to ensure they stay in compliance with their proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDetention Watch Network.

    "text": "In the 2008 film, Iron Man, the opening scene showed the hero, Tony Stark, in a US military convoy that is attacked by unseen aggressors. As Tony Stark is running for cover he sees an explosive with his own name about to detonate; he runs for cover but is captured by men who can only be heard speaking an indistinct Middle Eastern language. The movie goes on to show who Tony Stark was before his abduction, a patriot, an innovator, a weapons engineer, an extremely wealthy man in charge of a large company. Tony Stark’s character embodies an ideal American archetype, the self-made, rich, attractive, masculine, white man. He is captured by Arab men, identified as terrorists in the movie, and held hostage and forced to build weapons for the terrorist group to use against US forces. Instead he uses his elite skills to build a device that not only saves his own life from the shrapnel in his chest, but also powers his first Iron Man suit with which he escapes and goes on to protect the US and then the world from various threats. Iron Man uses the threat of non-American, non-white aggressors, in the form of militant rogue Arab men, to demonstrate Tony Stark’s ability to escape (with the aid of a fellow captive, a contrasting Arab man who martyrs himself in the escape) and return to neutralize the threat entirely.1\nIn the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, Middle Eastern Muslim men and Latin American drug lords have been portrayed as a primary threat against the US and its citizens, both in administrative rhetoric and mass entertainment media. Since the USSR began posing less of a threat against the United States in the 1980s, action movies such as True Lies (1994), Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection (1990), and the popular television show 24 (2001-2014) have reinforced the myth of a foreign threat of dangerous bad men.2 It was not only film and mass media that perpetuated this myth, it is also present in the legal system, especially following the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. The USA PATRIOT (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism) Act (2001) was an anti-terrorist act of congress and signed by George W. Bush in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The act was designed to lessen the judicial and executive oversight of the surveillance and detention of individuals and organizations suspected of terrorist activities. Almost forty years after the Civil Rights Act guaranteed rights for black citizens and over two centuries after the ratification of the United States constitution, the USA PATRIOT Act and much of the mass media are still positioning non-white or non-American men as a threat to US citizens and especially to American masculinity. “Good” men must be able to protect their families or country from “bad” men; as Iris Marion Young argues, “Good men can only appear in their goodness if we assume that lurking outside the warm familial walls are aggressors who wish to attack them.”3 In the case of Iron Man and the USA PATRIOT Act, the “bad” men are Arab men believed to be Islamic extremists who want to destroy the American national identity, if not the country as a whole.\nThis threat is not a new idea. Since the American identity began to form in the minds of white settler colonialists, this protectionist model of masculinity has been present in media. Media plays an important role in maintaining systems of white male supremacy as it is enables average citizens who consume media to relate to the issues and conflicts presented. As a distinctly American hero began to emerge in the arts of the new United States, the audience, whether readers of cheap novels or patrons of fine art, began to unify behind an ideal man that represented protection against common threats, both from outside and within, in the form of men of color. Though this ideal American masculinity that emerged certainly did not represent all men, but it provided a widespread common identity that much of the white male power structure could relate and use to justify legal and extralegal violence. To understand how racial violence has persisted, it is important to analyze the roots of its implementation, one of which is mass media.\nThe origins of American masculinity are most distinct in the years leading up to the Revolutionary War because the settler colonialist who had fought in the Seven Years War gained a sense of identity separate from the British through combat. War has often been a place where men build solidarity through combat against a common enemy. The first references to “Americans” as a word to refer to European settlers occurred during the Seven Years war. Most of these men were born in the colonies and believed they were fighting for their land and nation, not necessarily Britain’s land; the seeds of independence were sewn in this conflict, along with the seeds of a distinctly American identity.\nThe literature and visual art following independence expressed these specifically American ideals clearly through popular historical fiction of the time. During the Constitutional era and throughout the nineteenth century, Indigenous men were portrayed in fiction and visual art as savage, uncivilized, and unable to control their animalist urges, such as someone who would attack a family and kidnap young women. The Frontier officially closed in 1890, and the threat considered mostly neutralized, as the image of the “vanishing Indian” came to replace captive narratives. However, the simultaneous end of Reconstruction in the US South supported another invented threat that took its place in the foreground of popular fiction, the mythical black rapist. The American national identity, for as long as it has existed, has based itself on white masculinity and its superiority; in order for white men to consider themselves part of the true American identity, there must be men who are inferior and therefore a threat. Today, a primary target is the outside threat of Arab or Muslim men and Latin American immigrants, but it is a theme that began with origins of the American ideology. This artistic theme has continued throughout US history, replacing each archetypal aggressor as needed; literature, art, and other forms of mass media have influenced the motives behind systematic racial violence, both on institutional and individual levels, in a more subliminal but highly influential way."

    "text": "Many films have attempted to depict events surrounding the invasion and conquest of the Americas by Europeans, typically reiterating a similar colonial victory narrative: Europeans came to civilize, save, and subdue the native populations who were seen as savage, brutal, and pagan. Salvador Carrasco’s film, La Otra Conquista tells the story differently. Destruction and massacre, at the hands of the Spanish, forces Topiltzin to fight for his survival and the survival of his people’s culture and history. He refuses to submit to the Spanish and convert to Catholicism, but is spared by Hernando Cortes when Tecuichpo, Cortes’ concubine, reveals that Topiltzin is the illegitimate son of Montezuma, former emperor of the Aztec Empire. He is tortured and then held prisoner in a monastery with Friar Diego who attempts to conquer not only his body but his soul. In his mission to challenge Topiltzin’s strength of faith, Friar Diego struggles with his own faith as Topiltzin challenges him with equal resistance. The duality of the two beliefs becomes mutually influential to the conquering of both religions in the form they had existed and ultimately gives birth to a new form of coexistence. The idea of the merging of both identities to create a new single identity makes up much of the national Mexican identity. Though it does incorporate religious aspects and cultural aesthetics of Nahuatl, Mixtec, and Maya people, the national narrative attempts to replace Indigenous identities that still exists outside the hegemonic, post-colonial Mexican identity.\nLa Orta Conquista does a relatively good job of representing Nahuatl speaking people in Mexico in the early 16th century accurately, considering the little that is known with certainty and the scarcity of primary sources available. The appearance and the chain of events in the film are consistent with historical interpretations of codices from that time, with the exception of minor inaccuracies that have more to do with the film’s low budget. Because so much of the documents and possessions from the Aztec Empire were destroyed by Spanish Catholics when they were first encountered, it is hard to determine from what remains which interpretations are closest to the truth. The Broken Spears (2006) is an interpretation of different codices and accounts created within one generation of the events that set up the premise of the film; the accounts in the book, though they still contain some colonial influence, support the way the events and era are portrayed in the film.\nIn addition to the historical accuracy of the film, the depiction of both Mexica and European characters challenge many stereotypes reinforced by many portrayals in literature and film. These stereotypes are much of the foundation of myths about the conquest; myths like Indigenous people believing Cortes was the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl returning or all the Spanish being brutal soldiers with only the desire to murder and pillage. Both of these stereotypes or myths, along with others, generally portray characters of history as two-dimensional and unchanging, which is usually damaging to the truth of the events and representation of identity.\nCarrasco avoids these myths and stereotypes by creating dynamic characters. Both of the main characters, Topiltzin and Friar Diego, are humanized and have agency over their decisions; even Tecuichpo, who is a captive and concubine of Hernando Cortes, makes choices which determine her fate. Her character is based on la Malinche, the concubine and translator of Cortes, who is seen as a traitor for assisting the Spanish; the mythology surrounding her legacy remains to refer to Mexicans who prefer white identity and culture. An example is a Mexican woman who marries a white man may be labeled la Malinche as an insult implying she is a traitor to her race. However, Carrasco examines the complications of her position and her will to survive by showing her resistance within her self-preservation. After defying submission to Cortes by mistranslating his words to Topiltzin, Tecuichpo forges letters from Cortes as an act of resistance and revenge. She is cinematically shown as his equal, by speaking to him at eye level and not usually overpowered by him in spite of the fact that she is owned by him. The eyeline of characters as they interact is an important motif that appears throughout the film to represent the power dynamic between them. The simplicity of her myth is deconstructed by her agency and her sly assistance to Topiltzin.\nFriar Diego’s mission to use his divine power save the souls of the Native people is expressed in the way he looks down at Topiltzin after destroying the monument of the Mother Goddess which he calls a “handful of stones.” But as the film progresses, Topiltzin is seen rising to stand at eye level with the Friar in almost every scene they share; for example, when the Friar confronts him about the forgery, Topiltzin tells Diego “our encounter is inevitable, and eternal.” Again, when he is kneeling outside the sacristy looking at the image of Mary, he stands to face Friar Diego eye to eye when Diego talks for the first time about the idea of ‘truth’ in Topiltzin’s belief and the “new world.” Although Topiltzin is never seen above the Friar, his refusal to remain submissive proves his determination to retain his culture. His resistance and his strength of will shows that he is also influencing the Friar, and the ritual and religion he represents, and in a way conquering his mindset as well. While the film supports the national Mexican identity of these two societies influencing each other to create a new society to replace the old, the resistance of Topiltzin, though steadfast, seems to be complete by the end of the film, but is ongoing in modern Mexico.\nThe testing of each other’s strength of faith between Friar Diego and Topiltzin begins even before they meet. At the beginning, when confronted by his brother, Topiltzin says, “I will not adapt, I know who I am.” He does not wish to submit his body, as many others have, and only “be with our gods in secret.” Friar Diego begins to question the intentions of the Spanish and their representation of his faith first when he confronts Cristóbal on what appears to be his first day in New Spain, and again when he begs them not to shoot the Mexica performing a sacrificial ceremony by saying Cristóbal and his men are “behaving just like them.” Both men stand very firmly in their faith, but as they interact throughout the film, and although Friar Diego is persistently forcing his beliefs on Topiltzin, it is clear that the influence goes both ways.\nThe “other conquest” the film’s title alludes to is both the spiritual conquest by the Catholic missionaries, and also to the reverse “conquest” of the way Aztec culture and ritual influenced and forever changed the way Catholicism is practiced in Mexico. The film shows that both religions were changed forever by their encounter. The imagery comparing the duality of Mary and the Mother Goddess, representing women on both sides, and the ending scene when Topiltzin performs his ritual sacrifice with the statue of Mary signifying a birth of new ritual or religion. Both religions were forced to change and adapt to something new, but this does not replace the legacy of Indigenous culture in Mesoamerica.\nAlthough the dominance of the Spanish and their Catholicism is overwhelmingly and physically taking over the land and culture, Topiltzin’s resistance does not waiver. While he is being held captive at the monastery, Friar Diego personally is relentless in forcing his Catholic doctrine onto him. When Topiltzin develops a fever and has visions or hallucinations of Mary and the Mother Goddess; he sees a pendant with the image of Mary on the nun who is caring for him he cries out, “Mother! You can have my body, but my spirit never.” He later tells the Friar that “there is a reason he stays here,” although he is a prisoner, they both know that he could have left at any time if he wanted to. Topiltzin believes that the fate of the world relies on him. He believes that he must unite both beliefs, by destroying, or “conquering,” both so a new belief could be born. There is an image in Topiltzin’s vision of Mary being lowered down onto a platform, juxtaposed with the woman from the sacrificial ritual descending; Mary drops the baby in her arms and Topiltzin catches a real baby with white skin. This imagery shows the duality of the mother figures for both beliefs and the birth of something new. It also flips the traditional stereotype of the “white savior” protecting “uncivilized natives” by the “primitive” character embracing the white child instead.\nTo further examine that imagery, the scene after Topiltzin’s capture, when he is being tortured, there is a Mexican woman in the crowd holding a white baby whispering, “This is my body, this is my blood, even though you are white, I will never abandon you.” Tecuichpo repeats the first half this phrase to Cortes in reference to her own pregnancy after she has been imprisoned. This phrase serves to represent the bond between mother and child, but it is also an allusion to Jesus’ words and the Catholic ritual of taking of communion. The analogy of the Aztec ritual and beliefs being the mother of what becomes Mexican Catholicism is a powerful and unique way to approach the conquest of both body and mind, of the land and the soul.\nAlthough, in the film, Topiltzin is portrayed with autonomy over his actions and beliefs, when he sacrifices himself with the Virgin Mary and creates a new religious identity, the message is clear that the old way is gone, and the new, synthesized way is born. This plays to the national narrative of the formation of the Mexican state and discounts the descendants of Nahuatl and Mixtec people who continue to identify with their Indigenous culture and tradition. Guillermo Bonfil Batalla calls this the Mèxico Profundo, describing those living in Mexico but outside the national narrative which he calls “the imaginary Mexico.” Although, in modern Mexico City, blending of Indigenous and Catholic culture can be seen in the art and aesthetics of the common areas, such as Our Lady of Guadalupe; the mythology of its origin delegitimizes the actual history and contemporary presence of Indigenous communities. To say that this new cultural identity came out of the merging of two old cultures is to say that the old is gone and the new has replaced it; this is a fallacy because to say that traditional Catholicism is gone would be to discount all those who are practicing Catholics outside of Mexico, but this narrative does achieve this sentiment in discounting Nahautl, Mixtec, and Maya communities who exist in Mexico but continue practice their own culture outside that narrative.\nReligion in Mexico is not the only representation of the synthesis of Indigenous and colonial culture. The uniqueness of modern art in Mexico compared to European and US modern art is in part due to the influence of Indigenous classical art; Diego Rivera commented that pre-colonial Indigenous art is classical, not in the Western sense, but in the purity of its creation. When comparing pre-colonial Nahuatl and Mixtec aesthetics and Mexican modern art works such as those of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, it is easy to see the influence one has on the other. The most notable similarity in the two images below (the first is from the Codex Borgia and the second is a painting by Frida Kahlo entitled The Two Fridas) is the use of a stream of blood connecting the two figures; in the first the blood is connecting the death deity to human offering a sacrifice, and the second a stream of blood is connecting the hearts of two self-portraits of the artist. In addition to the influence on modern art, popular imagery, such as sugar skulls, are a clear “tie between popular and pre-Hispanic art” that Rivera observed the difference in the way Indigenous, historians, and upper classes of citizens and tourist each responded to their display in museums: Indigenous with reverence, historians for study, and citizens for entertainment. The popularity and consumerism surrounding these images works to consolidate Mexican identity and discount the thriving Indigenous culture which still reveres the symbolism and identity separate from the colonial narrative.\nAlthough, colonialism and Catholicism did conquer Mesoamerica legally in the long run, because of the resistance and strength of Nahuatl and Mixtec people and their beliefs, the conquest was never complete and never could be; Indigenous resistance – culturally, aesthetically, and religiously – influenced the nation narrative while also maintaining autonomy outside of that narrative. The strength of will and faith is an almost impossible thing to conquer, even if the land and the physical materials are; this resistance has been ongoing and persists through the 21st century.\nColonial resistance in Mixtec regions began with the initial contact with the Spanish and retained much of their land holdings for nearly a century through both physical resistance and within the Spanish courts. This resistance has not ceased in the five hundred years since the massacre depicted in the opening scene of La Otra Conquista and since the early 1990s the indigenous movements have still been calling for “the redefinition of the Mexican nation as a multi-ethnic – legally, socially, and politically – and guarantees for indigenous self-determination” including autonomy, the San Andrès Peace Accords on Indigenous Rights and Culture, and “redefinition of the relationship between Indian peoples and the Mexican state.”"

    "text": "Introduction\nIn 2022, the federal, state, and local governments of the United States held almost two million people in some form of detention in over 6,300 facilities (Sawyer & Wagner, 2023). The systems that contribute to this large number of incarcerated people in the US have been growing steadily over the past half-century. In 1998, activist and former political prisoner Angela Davis was the first to use the term “prison industrial complex” to refer to the massive industrialized profit-driven systems that make up the penal system in the US. She said the “prison industrial system materially and morally impoverishes its inhabitants and devours the social wealth needed to address the very problems that have led to spiraling numbers of prisoners” (Davis, 1998). As the prison industrial complex has continued to expand, much has been written about its effects on prisoners and the justice system itself as it has experienced exponential growth and more focus on profit opportunities instead of reducing harm or supporting public safety. However, the focus of this research is the effects that the privatization of prisons has on the local communities that host them.\nPrivate prison corporations like GEO Group and CoreCivic (CCA) build prisons in rural communities with the promise to bring jobs and a better quality of life to their residents. Rural communities often compete for these facilities in their towns because of these optimistic claims. However, the literature on the effects of these types of facilities does not necessarily agree that outcomes like employment growth are likely to occur due to new private prison constructions (Genter et al., 2013). Privatizing prisons, or any industry, converts the service from a public good to a private good; this commodification requires the extensive use of profit-driven tactics, and lowering costs becomes the top priority. Genter et al. (2013) argue that the profit-driven, cost-saving methods of private prisons do not stimulate the economy of host counties but instead divert local resources away from more effective solutions to promote economic growth.\nThere are currently fifty-nine prisons operating in Georgia, according to the Georgia Department of Corrections and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Most of them are located in rural areas. The expansion of the prison systems peaked in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of privatization and the popularity of tough-on-crime politics (See Figure 1). Of the fifty-nine facilities, all but seven are operated by the state or local government. Three are privately run facilities with contracts with ICE to detain non-citizens. The remaining four are privately run facilities with contracts with the state of Georgia to detain adult male felons (See Figure 2). Approximately half of all facilities in Georgia are state prisons, and county correctional institutions make up most of the remaining half. County institutions have the smallest average capacity, detaining approximately 266 adult felons. State prisons are significantly larger, with an average of 1,084 capacity for adult felons. However, the average capacity for private prisons was almost double that of state prisons at 2,069 (See Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Construction Timeline of Prisons in Georgia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Average Capacity and Type of Prison\n\n\nType of Facility\nAverage Capacity\n\n\n\n\nCo. Correctional Institution\n266\n\n\nICE Detention Facility\n1213\n\n\nPrivate Prison\n2069\n\n\nState Prison\n1085\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Prisons in Georgia by Type and Capacity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Georgia, two private prisons were recently constructed; one in Baldwin County in 2011 and another in Jenkins County in 2012. The GEO Group, who constructed and continues to maintain the Riverbend Correctional Facility in Baldwin County, boasted about the opening of the new facility in their publication for employees and their families. They claimed to bring “significant employment opportunities to Milledgeville and Baldwin County” (The GEO Group Opens Riverbend Correctional Facility in Milledgeville, Georgia., 2012). When the construction of the first prison was announced in 2010 for Baldwin County, Jenkins County was also bidding for that prison but would later get a contract through CCA to build a prison the next year (Bennett, 2010; Grant, 2010). In both cases, the private prison corporations promised jobs and investment in the local communities as a result of the new prison.\nThis analysis will compare these two counties to other rural counties in Georgia over the years following the construction of the prison using several quality-of-life indicators to assess whether these new prisons did improve the quality of life for the residents of these areas. For this analysis, counties are considered rural if they are more than 30% rural, according to the 2020 County Health Rankings data. The indicators analyzed involve crime (specifically aggravated assault), median income, unemployment rate, child poverty rate, and school attendance.\n\n\nData\n\nA variety of data was used to answer these questions about the change in the quality of life in these counties. Some of the data used were already formatted for use in ArcGIS as a feature layer. Other data needed to be combined with spatial information to represent it in the maps.\nThe Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students 2020 is a compilation of data from different sources related to factors that may influence educational outcomes developed by the Research & Analytics Group of the Atlanta Regional Commission into a feature layer for ArcGIS. Data sources include Georgia’s Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL) KOALA, Georgia Department of Public Health Online Analytical Statistical Information System (DPH OASIS), Fostering Court Improvement, Georgia Department of Education (GA DOE), Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI), and American Community Survey and Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) Program from U.S. Census Bureau. This data includes many variables ranging from basic population parameters and birth rates to economic indicators and crime reports. This analysis uses the following variables from this feature layer:\n\n\nNumber of Violent crimes reported: Aggravated assault 2010 and 2017 (AggAssault_2010 and AggAssault_2017, Long)\nChange, % Children under 18 years below poverty, 2010-18 (chpPopPovU18_e1018, Double)\n\n\nData from the United States Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) was used to assess each county’s median income change between 2010 and 2020. The data for 2020 was available as a feature layer from Esri Demographics; however, the data for 2010 was acquired directly from the Census Bureau and joined to the 2020 feature layer to be analyzed spatially and over time.\nThe County Health Rankings 2020 is available from Esri Demographics and contains many relevant variables. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute worked together to compile this data that measures health factors and outcomes of nearly all counties in the nation. In this analysis, the variables used were the Percentage of Unemployed (v023_rawvalue, Double) and the Rural Percentage (v058_rawvalue, Double) for each county. The County Health Rankings 2010 was accessed directly from the County Health Rankings organization; it was joined with the 2020 feature layer to assess the change in unemployment over time.\nThe Governor’s Office of Student Achievement publishes data on various educational metrics for Georgia schools and school districts. However, much of the school testing data covers only a short period since the tests often change every few years, and college admission tests only gauge high school students. To better understand school quality over a more extended period, attendance data is used for students of all ages for every school in each school district. The 2010-2011 school year data is combined with the 2018-2019 school year data to assess the change over time, then joined with school districts polygons (Ersi US Federal Data) for display.\nThough this analysis focuses on Baldwin and Jenkins County and the private prison recently constructed, other prisons in Georgia are included as a reference and to control for the difference between rural counties without and with prisons to determine if there is an overall difference. Data for all correctional facilities in Georgia was found on the Department of Corrections (DOC) website. Data attributes for all correctional facilities were obtained from the DOC website, including facility name, physical address, population, construction year, capacity, security level, and facility type. Only data for prisons and correctional institutions were collected; rehabilitation, probation, and transitional centers were excluded from this analysis. Also, it should be noted that the Georgia Department of Corrections does not oversee the three privately run facilities in Georgia that have contracts with ICE; these were added separately to the list of facilities in Georgia with the limited information available publicly from the ICE website.\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nBecause the data comes from several different sources, various methods were used to clean and organize the data. The first variable analyzed was crime using data from the Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students 2020 data, specifically aggravated assault crimes in 2010 and 2017. A new field was generated to calculate the difference in aggravated assault crime reports between each year for each county in Georgia (Change # of Aggravated Assualt Crimes 2010-2017, Chg_Assault, Long).\nThe next three variables are related to the economic indicators of the counties. The change in median income from 2010 to 2020 was determined by joining attribute values from the ACS for each year and calculating the difference after adjusting the 2010 values for inflation (Change in Median Income 2010 – 2020, Chg_Median_Income, Double). The values representing the change in the percentage of unemployed people for each county were calculated from the County Health Rankings 2010 and 2020 (Change in % Unemployed 2010-2020, Chg_Unempoyment, Long). The Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students 2020 data included the attribute for the change in the rate of child poverty calculated from 2010 to 2018 (chpPopPovU18_e1018, Double).\nThe final variable concerns education. School attendance data was collected from the Governor’s Office of Student Achievement for the school year 2010-2011 and 2018-2019 separately and then combined to calculate the change in the percentage absent over fifteen days (Chg_Over15Percent, Double). This data included an aggregate percentage of students absent more than fifteen days for all grades and all schools for each school district. The school districts were apportioned with the county boundaries to measure the expected average for each county, weighing the area of the school district encompassed within the county.\nFor reference and control over the variables, data about the rural percentage of each county was obtained from the County Health Rankings 2020 and was combined with the data collected from the Georgia Department of Corrections about prison locations. By isolating the counties that are more than 30% rural and those with or without prisons, the analysis could evaluate the differences between these types of counties and the two counties with new private prisons (See Table 2). After all the 2010 data had been updated and combined with the data from the later year, the field with the change in the statistics for each rural county was combined into a single layer for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Georgia Counties\n\n\nAll Counties\n159\n\n\nRural Counties (&gt;30% rural)\n135\n\n\nRural Counties without Prisons\n90\n\n\nNew Private Prisons\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings\n\nThough nothing about reducing crime is explicitly expressed in the promises made by private prison corporations, residents may expect that an increase in jobs and an economic boost would lower violent crime rates in the area (Ouimet, 2012). On the other hand, it is hypothesized that a new prison could affect assault crimes in the area. Aggravated assault includes domestic violence. Because people employed as correctional officers may be more exposed to a culture of violence within the prison in their work life, they may bring that home with them in the form of elevated violent crime such as aggravated assault (Valentine et al., 2012). The analysis of the data from the Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students 2020 shows that the overall change in aggravated assault crimes across all rural counties was an increase of an average of 9.81 reported incidents; for rural counties without prisons, the change was an increase of an average of 6.38 reported incidents. However, in Baldwin County, in the years following the construction of the Riverbend Correctional Facility, the number of reported aggravated assault crimes rose by 82 reported crimes from 2010 to 2017. In Jenkins County, the increase was slightly less than the rural county average at only four more crimes reported in 2017 than in 2010 (See Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Change in Aggravated Assault by County 2010-2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to the economic impacts on the communities hosting prisons in their county, this is where the corporations made explicit promises to make improvements. With the promise of adding hundreds of good new jobs, the new industry was expected to raise the median income of the county. However, because the lowest-paying jobs, such as janitorial positions, are often filled by the prisoners themselves; this can lower the average wages for the area since the most menial jobs can be underbid by the free or cheap labor of the prisoners (Genter et al., 2013). The analysis found that the change in the median income for all rural counties in Georgia from 2010 through 2020 was an increase of an average of $1,726 in 2020 dollars. Rural counties without prisons saw a slightly higher increase in earnings at an average of $2,203 from 2010 through 2020. Baldwin County fell right between these two averages, with an increase of $1,938 from 2010 to 2020. However, Jenkins County saw a sharp decrease of $7,234 in median income over the same ten-year period (See Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Change in Median Income by County 2010-2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampaigners for private prisons cite job creation as the number one incentive to build in depressed rural areas. Counties bid for these contracts specifically to bring new jobs to their communities, but is the impact on unemployment rates better in these counties than in other rural counties in the state? This analysis shows that, overall, in rural counties in Georgia, the percentage of unemployed fell by an average of 2.56 percentage points between 2010 and 2020. Rural counties without prisons saw a similar drop in unemployment rates on average. Baldwin County was also right on track with the county average for Georgia, with a 3-percentage point drop from 2010 to 2020. However, Jenkins County did much better than the average and better than any other rural county in Georgia, dropping 11 percentage points from 2010 to 2020 (See Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Change in Percent Unemployed by County 2010-2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from income and employment, the rate of children in poverty is another economic metric by which to gauge the well-being of a community. With the economic stimulation promised by prison corporations, the goal would be to help lift families out of poverty. This analysis shows that the overall change in the rate of children in poverty in rural counties in Georgia was an increase of 2.69 percentage points from 2010 to 2018. Rural counties without prisons had a similar increase of 2.25 percentage points. In Baldwin County, the change in the rate of children in poverty grew only a small amount more than in rural counties overall. However, in Jenkins County, the rate of children in poverty grew by 21.9 percentage points, well over the average for rural counties in Georgia (See Figure 6).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Change in Percent of Children in Poverty by County 2010-2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate prison corporations not only promise economic stimulation to communities that host their facilities, but they also promise to invest in the local community (Joseph, 2012). As a result of these promised investments, these communities should see an additional boost to educational and youth outcomes. This analysis demonstrates that the average change in the percentage of students absent more than 15 days for rural counties in Georgia was an increase of 2.86 percentage points from 2011 to 2019. Rural counties without prisons had an almost identical rate. The change in the chronic absenteeism rate in Baldwin County was just above the average for rural Georgia at a 3.49 percentage point increase. However, Jenkins County’s change in the rate was well above the average with a 4.9 percentage point increase (See Figure 7).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Change in Percent Absent More than 15 Days by County 2011-2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nOverall, in rural counties in Georgia, the number of aggravated assault crimes reported went up between 2010 and 2017. The economic factors were inconsistent. The median income rose from 2010 to 2020, and the unemployment rate fell from 2010 to 2020; however, the rate of children in poverty rose between 2010 and 2018. Chronic absenteeism for students also increased between the 2010-2011 and 2018-2019 school years. The findings for four out of five of these variables showed that Baldwin and Jenkins Counties fared worse or about the same as other rural counties in Georgia. The only variable that showed a positive impact was the unemployment rate, which was just a bit better than the average in Baldwin County but far better than the average in Jenkins County. Baldwin County’s changes were close to the average for rural counties for every variable except for the crime variable for aggravated assault crimes which was much worse. Jenkins County’s changes were worse than the average for three of the variables, median income, children in poverty, and attendance. The only variable for Jenkins County consistent with the rural average was aggravated assault crimes. In sum, it seems these new prisons did little to affect most variables and, in some cases, negatively affected them, except for unemployment rates (See Table 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Differences for Baldwin/Jenkins Counties and Rural Averages\n\n\nCounty\nAssault\nIncome\nUnemployment\nPoverty\nAttendance\n\n\n\n\nBaldwin County\n+71.15\n+$302\n−7.84\n+0.12\n+0.76\n\n\nJenkins County\n−6.85\n−$8,870\n−3.84\n+19.12\n+2.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion and Policy Implications\n\nThis research helps to inform stakeholders in these communities about whether these prisons were a wise investment. Rural communities looking to attract new industries to their area should consider that the private prison industry may not be the best industry to pursue as the unintended effects of toxic prison culture and practices may undermine the economic stimulation intended. It also supports those working to hold private prison corporations responsible for the unintended effects of their prison business.\nThe policy implications of this project are to highlight the unintended costs of the private prison industry and the prison industrial complex as a whole. Numerous studies have shown how imprisonment can harm those incarcerated and their families. Still, this research shows that the harm is not necessarily confined to those directly affected by the penal system. The communities that are home to these facilities may also face obstacles to improved quality of life due to the presence of an industry that preys on the vulnerable and seeks profit at any cost in the name of economic stimulation and public safety.\n\n\n\nData Sources\nCounty Health Rankings 2010\nCounty Health Rankings 2020\nGeorgia Counties\nGeorgia Department of Corrections\nGeorgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students 2020\nGovernor’s Office of Student Achievement - Attendance Data 2011 and 2019\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement\nUnified School Districts\nUnited States Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 2010 and 2020\ndata.census.gov\nReferences\n\nBennett, J.

As part of the US Census, these data are available from the census bureau directly. However, for spatial analysis the ACS and Esri, a leader in geographic information system (GIS) software, host spatial data along with various attributes from the survey (Esri, 2020).\nThe Context for Emergency Response feature layer contains 1475 records for Maryland with 89 variables including the coordinates and shapes required to visually represent attributes geographically at the census tract level. Information about factors that relate to emergency response includes the amount of the population without health insurance, internet access at home, or a personal vehicle. The website hosting the data provides metadata and details about each variable available.\nWhile the importance of these data for this analysis is primarily spatial, the variables about some of these characteristics could be useful for further research to identify other relationships with imprisonment rates of different communities. The spatial data for the census tracts can also be used to determine the distance to different types of mental health facilities."

Harris County decree, the end of the cash bail system requires website development with court information for arrestees, training on the amended hearing rules, representation for all misdemeanor arrestees at their bail hearings, supervision by an independent monitor, and hearings within 48 hours of arrest. Increased funding and amended hearing rules influence each of these activities. The outputs of the new policy are similar to the former system in terms of recorded numbers (i.e., rates of arrests, reported crime, plea agreements, recidivism, court compliance, etc.). Additionally, the average length of time someone spends in jail and the cost of detention and bail processes are measurable changes due to the reform. These measurable outputs are useful indicators that can be used to assess the policy’s impact on more abstract outcomes, such as reducing factors that contribute to poverty, crime and harm, negative economic impact, and increased equality in the justice system without compromising public safety.\n\n\n\nNew Logic Model"

Several of these outcomes have begun to garner attention from advocates publishing data on changes after these reforms (Heaton, 2022; Widra, 2022). Some of these outcomes are broad and difficult to measure, but inequality in the justice system can be measured in part by assessing disparities around racial identity and socioeconomic status in who chooses to accept a guilty plea deal and whether detained defendants are more likely to be convicted or receive longer sentences. Administrative data is available for both the bond amount and the outcome of the charges for both before and after the reform was implemented along with demographic attributes."

    "text": "Measuring Increased Equality in the Justice System\n\nTo measure equality in the justice system, economic and racial disparities must be considered. An obvious place to start might be with the rate of arrests, convictions, and sentencing across individuals with different economic and racial backgrounds because this could illuminate clear patterns of discrimination inherent in the system. However, the inequality on the part of law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, and laws has been well documented and reported on and does not necessarily correlate directly with the affordability of bail (Gase et al., 2016; Mitchell & MacKenzie, 2004; Racial Disparities in Sentencing, 2022; Threadgill et al., 2022).\nMany individuals have stated that they chose to agree to a plea deal because they could not afford bail and the alternative was to wait in jail for a court appearance (Subramanian et al., 2020). If the cost of bail was no longer an obstacle, the rate of individuals accepting plea deals should decrease because innocent people would not normally agree to a guilty plea without the coercion of pretrial detention.\nThe conviction rates for detained and released defendants are also measurable, and it is a good indicator of to what degree there is an advantage of not being detained when appearing in court (Dobbie et al., 2018; Gius, 2018). Individuals are to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, but appearing in court in a jumpsuit and shackles can give the impression of guilt even for innocent defendants. If bail reform allows people to be released from jail while they await trial, it follows that the implicit bias that leads to a higher conviction for detained defendants would be alleviated. While the rate of conviction for detained defendants may not be impacted for defendants who are not eligible for release at all, it would remove the economic barrier for many to have a chance of a fair hearing.\nTo measure the impact of bail reform on economic disparity in the justice system, the rate of individuals agreeing to plea deals after arrest and overall changes before and after the change. While collecting information from every arrestee about their reason for accepting or rejecting a plea deal is not feasible, using public records to compare trends before and after to determine if the rate of cases ending in plea agreements changed after implementation. If the probability changes after the elimination of cash bail for misdemeanors in Harris County, but not in a comparable county without the reform, it is evidence that release from detention was a primary reason for considering a plea deal."

    "text": "Causal theory\n\nThe claim that bail reform, or eliminating cash bail for misdemeanors, reduces the number of plea deals that defendants agree to take can be difficult to prove, but the logic does follow. The cash bail system requires arrestees to pay a court-ordered amount of money in order to be released from jail while awaiting trial. However, many individuals who cannot afford to pay must remain in custody until trial. There is logical and empirical evidence that individuals who can not afford to pay bail agree to plea deals regardless of guilt simply to be released from detention (Subramanian et al., 2020). Detaining individuals simply on the basis of their inability to pay before they are ever convicted of a crime leads innocent people to accept guilty pleas to avoid additional time away from their families and livelihoods. Based on this logic, it seems plausible that eliminating cash bail would cause fewer people to choose to accept a guilty plea since they can go about their lives while they await the opportunity to prove their innocence.\nThere are many factors that influence the affordability of bail and case outcomes (including plea deals), and sometimes both. Criminal record and the particular presiding judge may influence whether or how high bail is set; socioeconomic status (SES) also influences whether the amount is affordable, and race, gender, and family size may influence SES. The prosecutor may influence the judge, and white supremacy may influence both the judge and the prosecutor. Independently, the evidence of guilt, or lack thereof, may impact the prosecutor’s decision on both the request for bail, a plea deal, and the ultimate outcome of the case. The affordability of bail directly impacts the length of time someone is detained, but the length of detention for an individual awaiting trial is also determined by state resources to manage criminal cases. State resources also influence jail conditions, and both jail conditions and the length of detention can impact someone’s decision to accept a plea deal to expedite their release.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Causal Diagram for Bail and Result\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral of these factors cannot be measured directly or accurately, however, those factors can be controlled for by comparing Harris County to another comparable county with similar trends before the change was implemented. Using time (before or after the change) and location (Harris County or some other place), the impact of the policy change can be isolated. With the assumption that, if both places had parallel trends before the change, they would have continued to maintain that trajectory had the change not been implemented, the difference between the anticipated outcome and the actual income will estimate the isolated impact of the new policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Causal Diagram for Bail and Result\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.justify}"

It is also likely that the overall rate of conviction will decrease if defendants are released pretrial and are more able to seek legal counsel and retain their employment status. Even where convictions still occur, sentencing should be impacted as more defendants are able to prepare and present in court in their own clothes and with the support of their families and communities instead of in shackles and a jumpsuit with limited access to legal and emotional resources."

    "text": "Identification strategy\n\nIdentifying and measuring the actual impact of bail reform on equality in the justice system may be a difficult endeavor, but by using the rate of plea agreements for misdemeanors before and after the reform in Harris County and a comparable county with parallel plea agreement trends prior to implementation. As explained earlier, the assumption is that if the trends were parallel prior to the policy change, it is expected that the parallel trend would have continued without the change. Using this difference-in-difference method, the confounding factors that can not be easily measured do not obscure the impact of the new policy since it is assumed that those factors influence outcomes similarly in the treatment location (Harris County) and the control location. Using comparable counties, the public record data from each location serves as an account of a sort of “real world” experiment. In this way, the impact specifically from the changes to misdemeanor bail practices in Harris County can be isolated.\nIf it is true that many people accept plea agreements to resolve their case quickly due to inability to pay bail, elimination of cash bail should give those charged with a misdemeanor the opportunity to fight their case outside of jail. While surly some agree to plea deals for other reasons, the number accepting plea deals purely for economic reasons should shrink by removing this part of the financial barrier. To be sure, there are many other factors contributing to racial and socioeconomic status in the justice system, from court costs and access to adequate legal counsel, not holding people hostage simply for being poor may be a good place to start. The rate of plea agreements may not capture all of the dimensions of inequality, but it may indicate an attainable goal for improvement.\nThough comparing Harris County with a comparable county may estimate the impact of the reform in Harris County, it may not mean that the impact is generalizable to all communities. There may be a case that it would work in the control county used for comparison, since those places have been determined as comparable with parallel trends regarding plea agreements, but other considerations must be made to make assumptions about other places. However, a detected impact in Harris County would illuminate policymakers in other places who may be considering similar reforms."

Since the two locations are comparable and the trends regarding case outcomes were parallel before the reform, control variables are no longer essential to isolate the impact of the change. However, the demographic variables may be useful to assess whether the impact was greater for certain groups on average.\nSince the court decree was issued at the end of 2019, data from three years prior and three years after will be acquired from the appropriate court clerk’s office. With six years of data, establishing trends and identifying the impact of the change should be feasible, assuming there is an impact to identify.

Addition variables described above may also be available (judge, prosecutor, type of crime, etc.), and may provide insights to other disparities in the system, but are not necessary for this analysis.

    "section": "Prison Gerrymandering",
    "text": "Prison Gerrymandering\n\nPrison gerrymandering is the practice of counting imprisoned people as residents of the place where they are imprisoned. The US Census defines residence as “where [people] live and sleep most of the time” (US Census Bureau, 2018). However, incarcerated people cannot vote or participate in the community where they are detained, and they often maintain ties to their community of origin and hope to have a future there when they return. The practice of counting these people as part of a community in which they have no role not only boosts representation for people around a prison but siphons resources and representation from their home communities (Benveniste, 2022). Representatives in rural areas often lobby for new prisons in their district for the very reason of redirecting resources to their own constituents (Huling, 2002). Prisons are often far from the urban centers where most prisoners lived before incarceration. However, the main focus of this analysis is on how the PIC not only takes people out of their communities but also removes their citizenship in their home neighborhoods in matters that determine resource allocation and representation. Policies like these continue the legacy of attitudes about some individuals counting as only three-fifths of a citizen.. As more people are pulled away from their homes and counted in a place that does not value their interests, the barriers to opportunity are reinforced, and the cycle of subjugation continues.\nAs of 2021, about a dozen states had ended prison gerrymandering which would impact the redistricting from the 2020 Census (Fenster, 2021). Through the administrative process of this policy change, data have been made available about precisely where people in prison are from, and where they intend to return to (Widra, 2023). This information is valuable and unique because it provides a link to determine the conditions that both create an environment where people feel the need to imprison larger portions of the population and create nuanced solutions to reduce both the harm that leads to imprisonment and the harm caused by it."

    "text": "Mental Health, Crime, and Imprisonment\n\nMental health care is an important resource to ensure overall health and quality of life (Prince et al., 2007). The expansion of mental health care in the last few decades has been a response to a dire crisis that has long been ignored and stigmatized, and the benefits of access and awareness of mental health services are obvious to many who have utilized these services (Horton, 2007). Though access to mental health services is generally regarded as a positive influence on communities, the marginalized groups who often lack access to these services are the same communities that are targeted for high crime and imprisonment rates (Saxena et al., 2007). The link between access to mental health care, crime, and imprisonment is worth investigating to advocate for more resources to be made available for these communities and potentially prevent crime and harm before they happen, and as a result, reduce unnecessary imprisonment.\nBarriers to accessing mental health services exist in a variety of forms—awareness, affordability, and availability. The availability component is the focus of this analysis; availability includes the capacity of nearby facilities and proximity to facilities. While there may be a higher density of facilities in urban areas, compared to the populations in those areas, resources may not be available to individuals in need. Long waiting lists, staffing shortages, and a general lack of funding and resources for behavioral health are the result of health and public policy prioritizing more lucrative ventures (Butryn et al., 2017). Proximity to services may add to the issue of availability; especially in low-income rural areas, many people may not have the resources or time to travel long distances for preventative care, and facilities may be too far away to be able to adequately respond to crisis situations, leading law enforcement to fill that role.\nThree major components of mental health care and its relationship with imprisonment have been discussed: mental health care as prevention, mental health care for families and individuals impacted by the imprisonment of a loved one, and mental health care for formerly imprisoned residents upon release. Mental health care as prevention of criminal and violent behavior has been discussed in medical journals, but the evaluation of access to care in high imprisonment areas may provide important insights about reducing harm, both in terms of crime rates and imprisonment itself (Brennan et al., 2000; Hodgins et al., 2005; Petras et al., 2008). Increased access to mental health care, especially on a large scale could lead to an overall reduction in violent and aggressive behavior, which comprises most of the crime residents are most concerned about."

The imprisonment rate used the redistricting data from Maryland’s law ending prison gerrymandering to count prisoners as residents of their home neighborhoods instead of the location of the prison (Redistricting Data, 2020; Widra, 2023).\nThis new data can be used to identify what characteristics are common among places with high imprisonment rates. Combined with demographic data about these locations and the proximity of mental health resources, this data can highlight areas in need of more mental health resources to reduce the harm caused by imprisonment and over-policing. The abolition of prison gerrymandering is still ongoing, so this data is only available in limited locations. However, it can be used to shed light on the issue of prison gerrymandering and identify the common circumstances of places with high imprisonment rates."

Because this element was already processed and calculated, there are no missing values. Several outliers exist because of extremely low populations of several census tracts, the imprisonment of only one resident shows as a high proportion when normalized at a rate per 100,000 residents.\nThe US Census provides hundreds of attributes at the census tract level, however, these are often raw counts of individuals or households for each category. The estimates must be divided by the total counts to calculate the percentage of the population for each census tract for equal comparison. As with many large repositories of data, these datasets are missing some values for various variables. For the useful variables missing values, they are scarce and random; the values can easily be imputed for the important variables by finding the mean within the county of the tract. While outliers may exist in some categories, none were prominent in the variables selected for analysis. The values for each variable are numbers (with the exception of the geographic identifier and the name of the tract), however, they are not always stored as numbers and will need to be properly formatted.\nThe data about mental health facilities came from the National Directory of Mental Health Treatment Facilities 2020 as part of the Behavioral Health Services Information System Series (SAMHSA, 2020a).

The remaining variables were renamed with more meaningful names to better reflect the meaning of the values.\nThe merged data from the Prison Policy Initiative and the Census were joined to the ACS tracts in ArcGIS Pro for mapping.

The geocoded facilities were also joined the newly merged data by spatial proximity. The distance to the closest mental health facility from the edge of each tract was calculated in ArcGIS Pro in feet (as the crow flies) and then converted to miles. The dummy variables for the closest facility were also added to the dataset. This process was repeated for distance to the closest inpatient mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility providing crisis intervention, and the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins. Using ArcGIS, the total driving distance in miles and minutes was also calculated from the geographic center of each tract to the closest facility in each of these categories.\nThe complete dataset includes the imprisonment rate values from the Prison Policy Initiative, the selected attributes from the various Census and ACS tables, and the name, address, and dummy variables for the closest mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility, the closest inpatient facility with crisis intervention, and the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins, along with the linear distance, driving distance, and driving time to these facilities. These facility attributes were chosen because they represent opportunities for an alternative response to a dangerous situation that may be better resolved with mental health treatment than law enforcement and imprisonment. If individuals who are imprisoned were able to access mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment if they may be a threat, in a time of crisis instead of being forced into the stressful and prejudiced criminal justice system, immediate and long-term harm could be avoided."

The map of imprisonment rates in Maryland, shown in ?@fig-map1, highlights the concentration of high imprisonment in the Baltimore urban area. Since Baltimore is the largest urban area entirely in Maryland, it is not unexpected to see higher rates of imprisonment in the city and surrounding areas. However, the suburbs of Washington, D.C. are also partially in Maryland with comparable population density, but the imprisonment rate for those areas are much lower than the Baltimore suburbs. Though rural areas outside of the two major metropolitan areas seem to have lower rates of imprisonment overall, the southeast peninsula and northwest panhandle seem to have surprisingly higher rates. From this map, it seems that these areas are further from inpatient facilities, and the few in those areas may not have sufficient capacity for the large areas they serve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpectedly, the common indicators of inequality have a significant relationship with imprisonment rates. Median income, percentage of Black people in the population, percentage of the population with at least a bachelor’s degree, and the unemployment rate are all strongly and significantly related to high imprisonment. As educational attainment and income rise, the expected imprisonment rate falls, and as the percentage of the population that is Black and the unemployment rate rises, so does the expected imprisonment rate. Even when controlling for all of these factors, each has a significant correlation with the rate of imprisonment (see ?@tbl-regress1).\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Maryland does contain at least part of two major metropolitan areas, separating out the rural areas can provide insights into how relationships might change outside the city and how to plan and implement policies that target the needs of that type of community. However, ?@tbl-regress2 shows that the same tract characteristics are still significantly related to imprisonment rates, but with slightly lower numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crucial addition to this collection of census tract characteristics is the proximity to mental health facilities. As discussed earlier, access to mental health care, and specifically inpatient care when someone is in crisis, is not only an alternative to imprisonment, it may even prevent future harm and repair issues that can lead to criminal behavior. ?@tbl-regress3 shows little or even the opposite effect overall, but by isolating rural areas the relationship between distance and imprisonment is significant and positive, especially for inpatient facilities with crisis intervention or accepting walk-ins.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at all the models side-by-side in ?@tbl-regressALL, even controlling for the tract characteristics from ?@tbl-regress1 and ?@tbl-regress2, distance to facilities with crisis intervention has a significant relationship with imprisonment. Without accessibility to emergency mental health treatment, people in crisis are more likely to end up arrested, or worse, if police are the only option to de-escalate the situation.\n\n\nBecause urban tracts are overrepresented and more likely to be spatially close to a facility, the relationship is not clear, However, this does not account for capacity at urban facilities. According to the National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS): 2020, the average capacity of facilities across Maryland is 44 beds for inpatient clients (slightly lower than the national average of 49) (samhsaNationalMentalHealth2020?). Even assuming the facilities in Baltimore have a higher capacity than average, it is unlikely the four inpatient facilities within Baltimore City are equipped to adequately provide care to the city’s nearly half a million population. The map from ?@fig-map1 highlights that Baltimore has the highest concentration of high imprisonment rates in Maryland, but few facilities offering inpatient care for a large and densely populated area."

    "text": "Race and Income\n\nThroughout the state of Maryland, race and income are both strongly correlated with imprisonment rates. Race and income also have a strong relationship with each other. ?@fig-race1 visualizes the relationship between income, race, and imprisonment; the vertical and horizontal lines indicate the median income and average imprisonment for tracts with a majority Black population and those without a majority (though not necessarily a majority White population). Almost all the tracts below the median income for tracts with a Black majority are above average for imprisonment. It is also notable that the median and mean for these variables are quite different for each group. Not only is the racial income disparity obvious, but that disparity can lead to higher rates of imprisonment, adding a huge obstacle to economic success in already struggling communities.\n\n\nWhile proximity to mental health care appears to be a bigger issue for rural areas, which may still be low-income but less likely to have a majority of Black residents, imprisonment is still an important issue in these communities. Especially in the Baltimore area, the percentage of Black residents is highly associated with high imprisonment. ?@fig-map2 zooms in on two areas of Maryland with a high concentration of Black communities, the Washington D.C. suburbs and the Baltimore urban area. The darkest colors on the map indicate a high percentage of Black population and high imprisonment; the bright colors indicate that one is high but the other is low; the lightest colors indicate that both are low. In the D.C. suburbs there are some pockets that have high imprisonment, but many tracks with large Black populations, but relatively low imprisonment. However, in Baltimore, almost the entire area is high in both measures. It is worth investigating reasons the DC suburbs are not experiencing the level of imprisonment as in and around Baltimore, but that is outside the scope of this research."

    "text": "Access to Mental Health Care\n\nOutside urban areas, distance to inpatient mental health facilities is significantly associated with imprisonment rates. ?@fig-map3 shows the areas of Maryland with long travel times to inpatient facilities with crisis intervention and high imprisonment rates. As expected and explained earlier, the urban areas may be close and still have high imprisonment rates. But the southeast area has high travel times and high imprisonment but is not near a major city. This is an area where proximity is likely to play a larger role in accessibility and would be an area worth investing in more mental health resources. fig-MHF plots the relationship between driving distance and imprisonment rate; the lighter lines indicate the means for tracts that are not majority White (the diamond points), and the darker lines indicate means for tracts with a majority White population (circle points). In rural tracts, proximity to inpatient care seems to lower imprisonment rates for non-majority white communities.\nProximity to mental health care can not only prevent harmful criminal behavior, but it can also serve as an alternative for dangerous situations before they become criminal actions. Untreated mental health issues can put someone in a crisis, and without the tools to respond to that crisis, the person suffering and others can be in danger. If the only resource available is the police, who may not even be trained or equipped to confront a person experiencing a mental health crisis, there is a higher chance that the situation will either harm the person in crisis, others, or both. No one calls an electrician when a toilet overflows, why would you want to call the police when you need a doctor? Either no one is called and the person may become desperate and turn to illegal activity, or the police are called and unable to de-escalate the situation resulting in arrest, incarceration, or even death.\nMental health accessibility is also important for formerly incarcerated people returning to their communities to heal from the trauma of imprisonment and become capable of reintegrating and supporting their community. Prison is a traumatizing place, and some people spend many years locked up for minor, non-violent offenses but endure years of violence and trauma from other inmates and staff, and they may be more in need of mental health care than ever before. Communities experiencing high rates of imprisonment need investment in mental health, not only for prevention, but for rehabilitation as well."

    "text": "Subjects\n\nMost bail reform policies begin by limiting or eliminating bail for misdemeanor arrests. Without cash bail, judges retain the use of their discretion to remand defendants deemed a threat to the community or a flight risk. It is safe to assume that someone who is denied bail when bail is available, would not be released without bail. The focus of this study is people who are detained pretrial simply because they do not have the ability to pay bail, and who would presumably be released to await trial at home if reforms were enacted. Individuals who have been arrested for misdemeanor offenses, have not been denied bail, and are detained pretrial will be the subject of this research. Once the sample of respondents is selected, the organization will contact the facility with the list of individuals to be surveyed according to the previously established procedure for visitation. The scope of this study will be people detained in a single county jail over the course of four weeks."

    "text": "Design\n\nWhile survey research has its inherent weaknesses due to the nature of self-reported data, to understand and attempt to measure the emotional and social impacts of pretrial detention, it can be a useful tool to capture a more complete assessment of the unseen costs of these policies. By asking people directly impacted by the bail system quantitative questions about the level of impact on their families, and following up with the opportunity for respondents to expand on their answers in open-ended quantitative questions about the specific struggles their families are facing while they are detained. Though parents can only answer these questions to the best of their knowledge about how their families are impacted, it would be nearly impossible and unethical to ask children themselves since being separated from a parent or caregiver can already be a tumultuous and traumatic event for a child. The results of these responses can be compared to existing statistics about student performance and high-risk behavior in areas with high arrest rates, but these statistics would be generalized to the community and not the specific individuals and their families."

    "section": "Measures",
    "text": "Measures\n\nMeasuring abstract concepts like social support, family stability, mental health, and risk of negative outcomes offers challenges including important validity concerns. Support or risks may look different to different people; these concepts can be difficult to quantify. Below are examples of the broad nature of possible questions, and these questions will be supplemented with approximately five additional specific questions about each concept. Using a five-point ordinal scale for each general question and the additional specific questions, a composite of the specific questions can be used alongside the self-reported value of the general questions. By comparing the answers to both specific and general questions, the validity of each is strengthened if they are consistent.\nAmong the data collected, the variables hypothesized to have the most significant relationship with family outcomes are parental status, level of involvement, and the number of dependents; employment status or change in employment status; and the length of detention in days. Using regression analysis with these control variables should help to isolate the impact of detention on the well-being of children impacted by this system. Though the level of parental involvement cannot be asked outright, due to certain bias in the responses, by asking a variety of questions about the type of support, activities, and living situations regarding their children, a composite score from one to ten can be calculated to represent the level of involvement.\nFor example, to assess social support, additional questions about who is providing care and support to dependents while they are detained. The supplemental questions will be ordinal- or dummy-level variables, and some may be contingent on previous answers. The level of involvement indicated will provide a weight for some of the responses to reflect the expected amount of impact. For example, if the parent’s involvement is high (i.e., single parent without child support) questions may be weighted for higher representation. On the other hand, the responses from minimally involved or absent parents (i.e., parents with children in another state) will be weighted less. To further account for the validity of these subjective topics, each section of questions will conclude with an open-ended question about the topic for respondents to provide additional information and context.\n\n\nSample Questions\n\nHow much social support does your family have aside from yourself?\n\nIf you provide the primary financial support for your family, is there someone you know and trust who is able to ensure they have food and housing?\nIf there is another parent involved, has their involvement increased?\n\nHow would you describe your family’s stability while you are detained?\n\nHas your detention changed your family’s housing situation?\nHas your detention changed your family’s housing status?\nIs your family at a different residence while you are detained?\n\nIf so, are they with another immediate family member?\nAn extended family member?\nA non-related friend?\nA stranger/state custody?\n\n\nHow much do you expect that your detention will negatively impact your child(ren)’s emotional and mental health?\n\nHow old are your child(ren)?\n\nIf they are young, do they understand where you are?\nIf they are older, do you know how they feel about where you are?\n\nIf so, is it positive, negative, or indifferent?\n\n\n\nDo you think that separation from your child(ren) will increase the risk of negative outcomes?\n\nIf they are young, does your absence increase their exposure to unknown influences (different school, foster care, etc.)?\nIf they are older, does your absence decrease supervision, guidance, or saftey for your child(ren)?\n\n\n\n\nAn additional issue exists concerning the nature of the respondents’ social construction, and their awareness of the negative light in which detained people are viewed, regardless of their lack of a guilty conviction. Detained respondents know that the general public assumes they are guilty and would rather not think of them as people with families and lives outside of this unfortunate situation. This reality can lead to self-advocacy bias in responses. Respondents may want to appear more sympathetic by inflating or even lying outright about their involvement or expected impact. Unfortunately, there is no way to ethically avoid this altogether, but the strategy of asking specific follow-up questions and open-ended questions will hopefully reduce this possibility and help identify fraudulent responses."

    "title": "The Price of Pretrial Detention",
    "section": "Procedure",
    "text": "Procedure\n\nThis research project consists of the following six stages: a) obtaining approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB), b) designing and testing the survey, c) obtaining a sampling frame and determining the appropriate sample size, d) collecting data via supervised self-administered surveys, e) analyzing the data, and f) distribution of the results.\n\n\na) Approval\n\nSurvey research has less potential for harm to participants than more invasive methods might but considering the vulnerability of the subjects in this study, extra care must be taken to ensure their identities remain anonymous. While it would be useful from a data collection perspective to request personal information about respondents in order to follow up with them after their case is concluded to determine the long-term implications of pretrial detention, that approach would raise additional ethical and security concerns about the data that can be avoided by allowing respondents to remain anonymous.\n\n\n\nb) Survey Design\n\nWhile the main topics and variables have been determined, the exact wording and format of the survey will need to be designed and tested. Due to the sensitive nature of some of the topics of interest, it is important to include reviews and feedback from people who have direct experience with the criminal justice system. This includes people who have been detained themselves, family members of detained or formerly detained people, and individuals who participate in the process (judges, prosecutors, corrections officers, court clerks, etc.).\n\n\n\nc) Sampling\n\nSince the population of a county jail has continuous turnover, the sampling frame would need to be determined each day the survey is administered. Over the four-week period, one weekday (Monday - Thursday) and one weekend day (Friday - Sunday) will be chosen at random to select the survey dates. On the scheduled days, a list of individuals detained on misdemeanor charges will be obtained from the jail, and anyone who has been denied bail will be removed. From the final list, a sample will be stratified by the type and number of misdemeanor charges. The types and number of charges against individuals detained pretrial may vary greatly; some may be as innocuous as a public intoxication charge or even loitering, while others may involve violence or a large number of various criminal charges. Stratification ensures representation among varying severity and types of alleged criminal activity.\nWith a goal of completing approximately thirty surveys each day over eight different visits, the complete sample should contain around 240 responses. Once the collection day sample list is determined, the list of individuals will be sent to the facility in accordance with the predetermined visitation policy. Non-response is an issue that may be limited by the nature of detention; there are no prior commitments that could take priority for potential respondents, so there is an expectation for a high response rate. In the case that an individual selected does not wish to participate, an additional random selection from the strata from which they were drawn can be re-drawn to maintain the final sample size.\n\n\n\nd) Data Collection\n\nThe survey will be administered by one of two researchers, each with a goal of fifteen surveys per visit. Because of security and the bureaucratic nature of correctional facilities, delays and other obstacles are expected. Each survey should take about 15-20 minutes to complete. However, because these types of facilities are not known for efficiency, to reasonably meet a goal of fifteen surveys for each researcher, the amount of time for each response has been doubled.\nDetention facilities are equipped with small private rooms for detained individuals to meet with legal counsel and other advocates while detained. Access to these rooms can be acquired through connections and agreements between the organization and the facility. Each researcher will use a tablet with a digital version of the survey. Since the tablet must remain in the room, the survey will be answered by the respondent, but the research will be present for the duration. In a situation where the respondent has clarifying questions about the survey, the researcher will be able to clarify specific things according to a predetermined script.\n\n\n\ne) Analysis\n\nOnce the data has been collected, it will need to be cleaned and analyzed. Because the surveys were administered digitally, the responses will be automatically uploaded. Due to the validity issues discussed earlier, the data will be thoroughly examined to identify possible fraudulent answers. Answers that are inconsistent or very extreme and lack qualitative explanations in open-ended questions may be discarded. After careful cleaning and assessment, the data will be analyzed through multiple regression analysis including a variety of control variables to isolate the relationship between different individual characteristics and circumstances and the outcome variables identified.\n\n\n\nf) Distribution\n\nA final, simple report of the findings will be prepared along with several tables and visualizations of the result for publication through the organization and for distribution to policymakers considering reforms to the current bail system, both in this locality and others who are considering changes."

While there appears to be little to no disparity between White and Black defendants, it is important to note that Hispanic ethnicity is not available in the data. Approximately 43% of Harris County identifies as Hispanic according to the 2021 American Community Survey (US Census Bureau, 2020). However, many Hispanic defendants may have been recorded as White when the police arrested them. More nuanced data about the individuals arrested is needed to say conclusively whether there is a racial disparity for people accepting guilty pleas after arrest.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Harris County Guilty Pleas by Month"

Other than race, class is the next predominant factor that has been addressed by previous research; while race and class are inextricably intertwined, class conditions that lead to imprisonment stretch beyond the urban and racial factors usually associated with crime and subjugation (Eason et al., 2017; Pettit & Western, 2004). Outside of racial and economic barriers to care, Black Americans face cultural barriers and stigma surrounding seeking mental health care (Snowden, 2001).\nPeople in jails and prisons are more likely than the general population to suffer from a serious mental health issue, and the carceral system does the bare minimum to provide resources and health care to these individuals while they are incarcerated, let alone before and after their imprisonment (Cloud, 2014). The availability of mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment for individuals who may be a risk to the community, as an alternative to imprisonment has more potential to increase public safety and the well-being of communities."

    "section": "Prison Gerrymandering",
    "text": "Prison Gerrymandering\nPrison gerrymandering is the practice of counting imprisoned people as residents of the place where they are imprisoned. The US Census defines residence as “where [people] live and sleep most of the time” (US Census Bureau, 2018). However, incarcerated people cannot vote or participate in the community where they are detained, and they often maintain ties to their community of origin and hope to have a future there when they return. The practice of counting these people as part of a community in which they have no role not only boosts representation for people around a prison but siphons resources and representation from their home communities (Benveniste, 2022). Representatives in rural areas often lobby for new prisons in their district for the very reason of redirecting resources to their own constituents (Huling, 2002). Prisons are often far from the urban centers where most prisoners lived before incarceration. However, the main focus of this analysis is on how the PIC not only takes people out of their communities but also removes their citizenship in their home neighborhoods in matters that determine resource allocation and representation. Policies like these continue the legacy of attitudes about some individuals counting as only three-fifths of a citizen.. As more people are pulled away from their homes and counted in a place that does not value their interests, the barriers to opportunity are reinforced, and the cycle of subjugation continues.\nAs of 2021, about a dozen states had ended prison gerrymandering which would impact the redistricting from the 2020 Census (Fenster, 2021). Through the administrative process of this policy change, data have been made available about precisely where people in prison are from, and where they intend to return to (Widra, 2023). This information is valuable and unique because it provides a link to determine the conditions that both create an environment where people feel the need to imprison larger portions of the population and create nuanced solutions to reduce both the harm that leads to imprisonment and the harm caused by it."

    "text": "Mental Health, Crime, and Imprisonment\nMental health care is an important resource to ensure overall health and quality of life (Prince et al., 2007). The expansion of mental health care in the last few decades has been a response to a dire crisis that has long been ignored and stigmatized, and the benefits of access and awareness of mental health services are obvious to many who have utilized these services (Horton, 2007). Though access to mental health services is generally regarded as a positive influence on communities, the marginalized groups who often lack access to these services are the same communities that are targeted for high crime and imprisonment rates (Saxena et al., 2007). The link between access to mental health care, crime, and imprisonment is worth investigating to advocate for more resources to be made available for these communities and potentially prevent crime and harm before they happen, and as a result, reduce unnecessary imprisonment.\nBarriers to accessing mental health services exist in a variety of forms—awareness, affordability, and availability. The availability component is the focus of this analysis; availability includes the capacity of nearby facilities and proximity to facilities. While there may be a higher density of facilities in urban areas, compared to the populations in those areas, resources may not be available to individuals in need. Long waiting lists, staffing shortages, and a general lack of funding and resources for behavioral health are the result of health and public policy prioritizing more lucrative ventures (Butryn et al., 2017). Proximity to services may add to the issue of availability; especially in low-income rural areas, many people may not have the resources or time to travel long distances for preventative care, and facilities may be too far away to be able to adequately respond to crisis situations, leading law enforcement to fill that role.\nThree major components of mental health care and its relationship with imprisonment have been discussed: mental health care as prevention, mental health care for families and individuals impacted by the imprisonment of a loved one, and mental health care for formerly imprisoned residents upon release. Mental health care as prevention of criminal and violent behavior has been discussed in medical journals, but the evaluation of access to care in high imprisonment areas may provide important insights about reducing harm, both in terms of crime rates and imprisonment itself (Brennan et al., 2000; Hodgins et al., 2005; Petras et al., 2008). Increased access to mental health care, especially on a large scale could lead to an overall reduction in violent and aggressive behavior, which comprises most of the crime residents are most concerned about."

The obvious demographic and socioeconomic factors should be considered and potentially controlled in many analyses. Investigating spatial relationships to evaluate dimensions of the accessibility, in terms of distance and capacity, to mental health facilities. While there are many dimensions to the concept of accessibility, distance can be a useful indicator of at least when mental health care options are not available. The inpatient and daily capacities of urban facilities may reveal a different aspect of accessibility, especially in densely populated areas. Other dimensions to consider might be specific services provided, populations served, payment methods accepted, and outreach or awareness of services available. This analysis focuses on the dimensions of proximity and capacity as indicators of access to mental health care, specifically inpatient care for emergency situations. Tracts with a higher proportion of Black residents are predicted to have higher imprisonment rates, and median income is likely to be negatively related to imprisonment rates. In rural areas, proximity is expected to have a stronger positive correlation with imprisonment, whereas we anticipate capacity to be more negatively influential in urban areas."

The data originated as administrative data from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and was combined with population data from the Census. The Prison Policy Initiative collected, calculated, and combined this data for public use for various levels of geography for Maryland and eleven other states where prison gerrymandering has been overruled. The imprisonment rate used the redistricting data from Maryland’s law ending prison gerrymandering to count prisoners as residents of their home neighborhoods instead of the location of the prison (Redistricting Data, 2020; Widra, 2023).\nThis new data can be used to identify what characteristics are common among places with high imprisonment rates. Combined with demographic data about these locations and the proximity of mental health resources, this data can highlight areas in need of more mental health resources to reduce the harm caused by imprisonment and over-policing. The abolition of prison gerrymandering is still ongoing, so this data is only available in limited locations. However, it can be used to shed light on the issue of prison gerrymandering and identify the common circumstances of places with high imprisonment rates."

In combination with the imprisonment data, the census data can show correlations between the racial and socioeconomic characteristics of an area and the rate of imprisonment and help to conceptualize the systematic ways that incarceration and the Prison Industrial Complex as a whole impact people of color and low-income communities disproportionately."

    "text": "Variables\nThe dependent variable is the imprisonment rate per 100,000 residents for each census tract in Maryland. As described above, this variable was calculated by the Prison Policy Initiative and comes from administrative data made available by policies ending the practice of prison gerrymandering in Maryland (Redistricting Data, 2020; Widra, 2023). Using census tracts as the unit of analysis and GIS to determine the distance to the nearest mental health facility with various characteristics, including inpatient care and crisis intervention services, we can measure a dimension of accessibility of mental health care, particularly during a crisis to avoid involving law enforcement.\nThe independent variables are grouped into two categories: established indicators, demographic and socioeconomic factors known to be associated with imprisonment and involvement with the criminal justice system, and our primary explanatory variables measure the distance in miles and minutes between the geographical center of each tract and the nearest facility. See ?@tbl-vars for the specific variables and the source of the data for each.\n\n\n\nThe primary explanatory variables are divided into three groups, (1) mental health facilities, (2) facilities with inpatient care, and (3) inpatient facilities with crisis intervention services. Within each group, two measures for each type of facility have been calculated, (a) travel time in minutes (at 9:00 AM on a weekday) and (b) driving distance in miles (see ?@tbl-vars2).\n\n\n\nBecause urban areas are likely to have a shorter distance to a facility due to proximity to a city, the capacity of urban facilities may be more critical to determining the accessibility of these services when they are needed. However, mental health facilities are not transparent or forthcoming about the details of their capacity and services with the public, and these data were not able to be obtained for this research. It is important to note that within the city of Baltimore, Maryland’s largest urban area (which contains the highest rates of imprisonment), there is only one inpatient facility according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in 2021. The single inpatient facility in Baltimore city does not offer crisis intervention services. Even without exact numbers, it is highly likely that one facility does not have enough capacity to serve a city with more than half a million residents, let alone a city with a reputation for crime and police violence."

    "section": "Overall",
    "text": "Overall\nWith this complete analytic dataset, visualizing the primary variables, imprisonment rate and inpatient mental health facilities, on a map provides some preliminary context for greater research questions. The map of imprisonment rates in Maryland, shown in ?@fig-map1, highlights the concentration of high imprisonment in the Baltimore urban area. Since Baltimore is the largest urban area entirely in Maryland, it is not unexpected to see higher rates of imprisonment in the city and surrounding areas. However, the suburbs of Washington, D.C. are also partially in Maryland with comparable population density, but the imprisonment rate for those areas are much lower than the Baltimore suburbs. Though rural areas outside of the two major metropolitan areas seem to have lower rates of imprisonment overall, the southeast peninsula and northwest panhandle seem to have surprisingly higher rates. From this map, it seems that these areas are further from inpatient facilities, and the few in those areas may not have sufficient capacity for the large areas they serve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpectedly, the common indicators of inequality have a significant relationship with imprisonment rates. Median income, percentage of Black people in the population, percentage of the population with at least a bachelor’s degree, and the unemployment rate are all strongly and significantly related to high imprisonment. As educational attainment and income rise, the expected imprisonment rate falls, and as the percentage of the population that is Black and the unemployment rate rises, so does the expected imprisonment rate. Even when controlling for all of these factors, each has a significant correlation with the rate of imprisonment (see ?@tbl-regress1).\n\n\n\nSince Maryland does contain at least part of two major metropolitan areas, separating out the rural areas can provide insights into how relationships might change outside the city and how to plan and implement policies that target the needs of that type of community. However, ?@tbl-regress2 shows that the same tract characteristics are still significantly related to imprisonment rates, but with slightly lower numbers.\n\n\n\nThe crucial addition to this collection of census tract characteristics is the proximity to mental health facilities. As discussed earlier, access to mental health care, and specifically inpatient care when someone is in crisis, is not only an alternative to imprisonment, it may even prevent future harm and repair issues that can lead to criminal behavior. ?@tbl-regress3 shows little or even the opposite effect overall, but by isolating rural areas the relationship between distance and imprisonment is significant and positive, especially for inpatient facilities with crisis intervention or accepting walk-ins.\n\n\n\nLooking at all the models side-by-side in ?@tbl-regressALL, even controlling for the tract characteristics from ?@tbl-regress1 and ?@tbl-regress2, distance to facilities with crisis intervention has a significant relationship with imprisonment. Without accessibility to emergency mental health treatment, people in crisis are more likely to end up arrested, or worse, if police are the only option to de-escalate the situation.\nBecause urban tracts are overrepresented and more likely to be spatially close to a facility, the relationship is not clear, However, this does not account for capacity at urban facilities. According to the National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS): 2020, the average capacity of facilities across Maryland is 44 beds for inpatient clients (slightly lower than the national average of 49) (samhsaNationalMentalHealth2020?). Even assuming the facilities in Baltimore have a higher capacity than average, it is unlikely the four inpatient facilities within Baltimore City are equipped to adequately provide care to the city’s nearly half a million population. The map from ?@fig-map1 highlights that Baltimore has the highest concentration of high imprisonment rates in Maryland, but few facilities offering inpatient care for a large and densely populated area."

    "section": "Race and Income",
    "text": "Race and Income\nThroughout the state of Maryland, race and income are both strongly correlated with imprisonment rates. Race and income also have a strong relationship with each other. ?@fig-race1 visualizes the relationship between income, race, and imprisonment; the vertical and horizontal lines indicate the median income and average imprisonment for tracts with a majority Black population and those without a majority (though not necessarily a majority White population). Almost all the tracts below the median income for tracts with a Black majority are above average for imprisonment. It is also notable that the median and mean for these variables are quite different for each group. Not only is the racial income disparity obvious, but that disparity can lead to higher rates of imprisonment, adding a huge obstacle to economic success in already struggling communities.\nWhile proximity to mental health care appears to be a bigger issue for rural areas, which may still be low-income but less likely to have a majority of Black residents, imprisonment is still an important issue in these communities. Especially in the Baltimore area, the percentage of Black residents is highly associated with high imprisonment. ?@fig-map2 zooms in on two areas of Maryland with a high concentration of Black communities, the Washington D.C. suburbs and the Baltimore urban area. The darkest colors on the map indicate a high percentage of Black population and high imprisonment; the bright colors indicate that one is high but the other is low; the lightest colors indicate that both are low. In the D.C. suburbs there are some pockets that have high imprisonment, but many tracks with large Black populations, but relatively low imprisonment. However, in Baltimore, almost the entire area is high in both measures. It is worth investigating reasons the DC suburbs are not experiencing the level of imprisonment as in and around Baltimore, but that is outside the scope of this research."

    "section": "Access to Mental Health Care",
    "text": "Access to Mental Health Care\nOutside urban areas, distance to inpatient mental health facilities is significantly associated with imprisonment rates. ?@fig-map3 shows the areas of Maryland with long travel times to inpatient facilities with crisis intervention and high imprisonment rates. As expected and explained earlier, the urban areas may be close and still have high imprisonment rates. But the southeast area has high travel times and high imprisonment but is not near a major city. This is an area where proximity is likely to play a larger role in accessibility and would be an area worth investing in more mental health resources. fig-MHF plots the relationship between driving distance and imprisonment rate; the lighter lines indicate the means for tracts that are not majority White (the diamond points), and the darker lines indicate means for tracts with a majority White population (circle points). In rural tracts, proximity to inpatient care seems to lower imprisonment rates for non-majority white communities.\nProximity to mental health care can not only prevent harmful criminal behavior, but it can also serve as an alternative for dangerous situations before they become criminal actions. Untreated mental health issues can put someone in a crisis, and without the tools to respond to that crisis, the person suffering and others can be in danger. If the only resource available is the police, who may not even be trained or equipped to confront a person experiencing a mental health crisis, there is a higher chance that the situation will either harm the person in crisis, others, or both. No one calls an electrician when a toilet overflows, why would you want to call the police when you need a doctor? Either no one is called and the person may become desperate and turn to illegal activity, or the police are called and unable to de-escalate the situation resulting in arrest, incarceration, or even death.\nMental health accessibility is also important for formerly incarcerated people returning to their communities to heal from the trauma of imprisonment and become capable of reintegrating and supporting their community. Prison is a traumatizing place, and some people spend many years locked up for minor, non-violent offenses but endure years of violence and trauma from other inmates and staff, and they may be more in need of mental health care than ever before. Communities experiencing high rates of imprisonment need investment in mental health, not only for prevention, but for rehabilitation as well."

    "text": "Introduction\nIn 2022, the federal, state, and local governments of the United States held almost two million people in some form of detention in over 6,300 facilities (Sawyer & Wagner, 2023). The systems that contribute to this large number of incarcerated people in the US have been growing steadily over the past half-century. In 1998, activist and former political prisoner Angela Davis was the first to use the term “prison industrial complex” to refer to the massive industrialized profit-driven systems that make up the penal system in the US. She said the “prison industrial system materially and morally impoverishes its inhabitants and devours the social wealth needed to address the very problems that have led to spiraling numbers of prisoners” (Davis, 1998). As the prison industrial complex has continued to expand, much has been written about its effects on prisoners and the justice system itself as it has experienced exponential growth and more focus on profit opportunities instead of reducing harm or supporting public safety. However, the focus of this research is the effects that the privatization of prisons has on the local communities that host them.\nPrivate prison corporations like GEO Group and CoreCivic (CCA) build prisons in rural communities with the promise to bring jobs and a better quality of life to their residents. Rural communities often compete for these facilities in their towns because of these optimistic claims. However, the literature on the effects of these types of facilities does not necessarily agree that outcomes like employment growth are likely to occur due to new private prison constructions (Genter et al., 2013). Privatizing prisons, or any industry, converts the service from a public good to a private good; this commodification requires the extensive use of profit-driven tactics, and lowering costs becomes the top priority. Genter et al. (2013) argue that the profit-driven, cost-saving methods of private prisons do not stimulate the economy of host counties but instead divert local resources away from more effective solutions to promote economic growth.\nThere are currently fifty-nine prisons operating in Georgia, according to the Georgia Department of Corrections and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Most of them are located in rural areas. The expansion of the prison systems peaked in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of privatization and the popularity of tough-on-crime politics (See Figure 1). Of the fifty-nine facilities, all but seven are operated by the state or local government. Three are privately run facilities with contracts with ICE to detain non-citizens. The remaining four are privately run facilities with contracts with the state of Georgia to detain adult male felons (See Figure 2). Approximately half of all facilities in Georgia are state prisons, and county correctional institutions make up most of the remaining half. County institutions have the smallest average capacity, detaining approximately 266 adult felons. State prisons are significantly larger, with an average of 1,084 capacity for adult felons. However, the average capacity for private prisons was almost double that of state prisons at 2,069 (See Table 1).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Construction Timeline of Prisons in Georgia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Average Capacity and Type of Prison\n\n\nType of Facility\nAverage Capacity\n\n\n\n\nCo. Correctional Institution\n266\n\n\nICE Detention Facility\n1213\n\n\nPrivate Prison\n2069\n\n\nState Prison\n1085\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Prisons in Georgia by Type and Capacity\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Georgia, two private prisons were recently constructed; one in Baldwin County in 2011 and another in Jenkins County in 2012. The GEO Group, who constructed and continues to maintain the Riverbend Correctional Facility in Baldwin County, boasted about the opening of the new facility in their publication for employees and their families. They claimed to bring “significant employment opportunities to Milledgeville and Baldwin County” (The GEO Group Opens Riverbend Correctional Facility in Milledgeville, Georgia., 2012). When the construction of the first prison was announced in 2010 for Baldwin County, Jenkins County was also bidding for that prison but would later get a contract through CCA to build a prison the next year (Bennett, 2010; Grant, 2010). In both cases, the private prison corporations promised jobs and investment in the local communities as a result of the new prison.\nThis analysis will compare these two counties to other rural counties in Georgia over the years following the construction of the prison using several quality-of-life indicators to assess whether these new prisons did improve the quality of life for the residents of these areas. For this analysis, counties are considered rural if they are more than 30% rural, according to the 2020 County Health Rankings data. The indicators analyzed involve crime (specifically aggravated assault), median income, unemployment rate, child poverty rate, and school attendance.\n\n\nData\nA variety of data was used to answer these questions about the change in the quality of life in these counties. Some of the data used were already formatted for use in ArcGIS as a feature layer. Other data needed to be combined with spatial information to represent it in the maps.\nThe Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students 2020 is a compilation of data from different sources related to factors that may influence educational outcomes developed by the Research & Analytics Group of the Atlanta Regional Commission into a feature layer for ArcGIS. Data sources include Georgia’s Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL) KOALA, Georgia Department of Public Health Online Analytical Statistical Information System (DPH OASIS), Fostering Court Improvement, Georgia Department of Education (GA DOE), Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI), and American Community Survey and Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) Program from U.S. Census Bureau. This data includes many variables ranging from basic population parameters and birth rates to economic indicators and crime reports. This analysis uses the following variables from this feature layer:\n\nNumber of Violent crimes reported: Aggravated assault 2010 and 2017 (AggAssault_2010 and AggAssault_2017, Long)\nChange, % Children under 18 years below poverty, 2010-18 (chpPopPovU18_e1018, Double)\n\nData from the United States Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) was used to assess each county’s median income change between 2010 and 2020. The data for 2020 was available as a feature layer from Esri Demographics; however, the data for 2010 was acquired directly from the Census Bureau and joined to the 2020 feature layer to be analyzed spatially and over time.\nThe County Health Rankings 2020 is available from Esri Demographics and contains many relevant variables. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute worked together to compile this data that measures health factors and outcomes of nearly all counties in the nation. In this analysis, the variables used were the Percentage of Unemployed (v023_rawvalue, Double) and the Rural Percentage (v058_rawvalue, Double) for each county. The County Health Rankings 2010 was accessed directly from the County Health Rankings organization; it was joined with the 2020 feature layer to assess the change in unemployment over time.\nThe Governor’s Office of Student Achievement publishes data on various educational metrics for Georgia schools and school districts. However, much of the school testing data covers only a short period since the tests often change every few years, and college admission tests only gauge high school students. To better understand school quality over a more extended period, attendance data is used for students of all ages for every school in each school district. The 2010-2011 school year data is combined with the 2018-2019 school year data to assess the change over time, then joined with school districts polygons (Ersi US Federal Data) for display.\nThough this analysis focuses on Baldwin and Jenkins County and the private prison recently constructed, other prisons in Georgia are included as a reference and to control for the difference between rural counties without and with prisons to determine if there is an overall difference. Data for all correctional facilities in Georgia was found on the Department of Corrections (DOC) website. Data attributes for all correctional facilities were obtained from the DOC website, including facility name, physical address, population, construction year, capacity, security level, and facility type. Only data for prisons and correctional institutions were collected; rehabilitation, probation, and transitional centers were excluded from this analysis. Also, it should be noted that the Georgia Department of Corrections does not oversee the three privately run facilities in Georgia that have contracts with ICE; these were added separately to the list of facilities in Georgia with the limited information available publicly from the ICE website.\n\n\nMethods\nBecause the data comes from several different sources, various methods were used to clean and organize the data. The first variable analyzed was crime using data from the Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students 2020 data, specifically aggravated assault crimes in 2010 and 2017. A new field was generated to calculate the difference in aggravated assault crime reports between each year for each county in Georgia (Change # of Aggravated Assualt Crimes 2010-2017, Chg_Assault, Long).\nThe next three variables are related to the economic indicators of the counties. The change in median income from 2010 to 2020 was determined by joining attribute values from the ACS for each year and calculating the difference after adjusting the 2010 values for inflation (Change in Median Income 2010 – 2020, Chg_Median_Income, Double). The values representing the change in the percentage of unemployed people for each county were calculated from the County Health Rankings 2010 and 2020 (Change in % Unemployed 2010-2020, Chg_Unempoyment, Long). The Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students 2020 data included the attribute for the change in the rate of child poverty calculated from 2010 to 2018 (chpPopPovU18_e1018, Double).\nThe final variable concerns education. School attendance data was collected from the Governor’s Office of Student Achievement for the school year 2010-2011 and 2018-2019 separately and then combined to calculate the change in the percentage absent over fifteen days (Chg_Over15Percent, Double). This data included an aggregate percentage of students absent more than fifteen days for all grades and all schools for each school district. The school districts were apportioned with the county boundaries to measure the expected average for each county, weighing the area of the school district encompassed within the county.\nFor reference and control over the variables, data about the rural percentage of each county was obtained from the County Health Rankings 2020 and was combined with the data collected from the Georgia Department of Corrections about prison locations. By isolating the counties that are more than 30% rural and those with or without prisons, the analysis could evaluate the differences between these types of counties and the two counties with new private prisons (See Table 2). After all the 2010 data had been updated and combined with the data from the later year, the field with the change in the statistics for each rural county was combined into a single layer for analysis.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Georgia Counties\n\n\nAll Counties\n159\n\n\nRural Counties (&gt;30% rural)\n135\n\n\nRural Counties without Prisons\n90\n\n\nNew Private Prisons\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings\nThough nothing about reducing crime is explicitly expressed in the promises made by private prison corporations, residents may expect that an increase in jobs and an economic boost would lower violent crime rates in the area (Ouimet, 2012). On the other hand, it is hypothesized that a new prison could affect assault crimes in the area. Aggravated assault includes domestic violence. Because people employed as correctional officers may be more exposed to a culture of violence within the prison in their work life, they may bring that home with them in the form of elevated violent crime such as aggravated assault (Valentine et al., 2012). The analysis of the data from the Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students 2020 shows that the overall change in aggravated assault crimes across all rural counties was an increase of an average of 9.81 reported incidents; for rural counties without prisons, the change was an increase of an average of 6.38 reported incidents. However, in Baldwin County, in the years following the construction of the Riverbend Correctional Facility, the number of reported aggravated assault crimes rose by 82 reported crimes from 2010 to 2017. In Jenkins County, the increase was slightly less than the rural county average at only four more crimes reported in 2017 than in 2010 (See Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Change in Aggravated Assault by County 2010-2017\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to the economic impacts on the communities hosting prisons in their county, this is where the corporations made explicit promises to make improvements. With the promise of adding hundreds of good new jobs, the new industry was expected to raise the median income of the county. However, because the lowest-paying jobs, such as janitorial positions, are often filled by the prisoners themselves; this can lower the average wages for the area since the most menial jobs can be underbid by the free or cheap labor of the prisoners (Genter et al., 2013). The analysis found that the change in the median income for all rural counties in Georgia from 2010 through 2020 was an increase of an average of $1,726 in 2020 dollars. Rural counties without prisons saw a slightly higher increase in earnings at an average of $2,203 from 2010 through 2020. Baldwin County fell right between these two averages, with an increase of $1,938 from 2010 to 2020. However, Jenkins County saw a sharp decrease of $7,234 in median income over the same ten-year period (See Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Change in Median Income by County 2010-2020\n\n\n\n\n\nCampaigners for private prisons cite job creation as the number one incentive to build in depressed rural areas. Counties bid for these contracts specifically to bring new jobs to their communities, but is the impact on unemployment rates better in these counties than in other rural counties in the state? This analysis shows that, overall, in rural counties in Georgia, the percentage of unemployed fell by an average of 2.56 percentage points between 2010 and 2020. Rural counties without prisons saw a similar drop in unemployment rates on average. Baldwin County was also right on track with the county average for Georgia, with a 3-percentage point drop from 2010 to 2020. However, Jenkins County did much better than the average and better than any other rural county in Georgia, dropping 11 percentage points from 2010 to 2020 (See Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Change in Percent Unemployed by County 2010-2020\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from income and employment, the rate of children in poverty is another economic metric by which to gauge the well-being of a community. With the economic stimulation promised by prison corporations, the goal would be to help lift families out of poverty. This analysis shows that the overall change in the rate of children in poverty in rural counties in Georgia was an increase of 2.69 percentage points from 2010 to 2018. Rural counties without prisons had a similar increase of 2.25 percentage points. In Baldwin County, the change in the rate of children in poverty grew only a small amount more than in rural counties overall. However, in Jenkins County, the rate of children in poverty grew by 21.9 percentage points, well over the average for rural counties in Georgia (See Figure 6).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Change in Percent of Children in Poverty by County 2010-2018\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate prison corporations not only promise economic stimulation to communities that host their facilities, but they also promise to invest in the local community (Joseph, 2012). As a result of these promised investments, these communities should see an additional boost to educational and youth outcomes. This analysis demonstrates that the average change in the percentage of students absent more than 15 days for rural counties in Georgia was an increase of 2.86 percentage points from 2011 to 2019. Rural counties without prisons had an almost identical rate. The change in the chronic absenteeism rate in Baldwin County was just above the average for rural Georgia at a 3.49 percentage point increase. However, Jenkins County’s change in the rate was well above the average with a 4.9 percentage point increase (See Figure 7).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Change in Percent Absent More than 15 Days by County 2011-2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nOverall, in rural counties in Georgia, the number of aggravated assault crimes reported went up between 2010 and 2017. The economic factors were inconsistent. The median income rose from 2010 to 2020, and the unemployment rate fell from 2010 to 2020; however, the rate of children in poverty rose between 2010 and 2018. Chronic absenteeism for students also increased between the 2010-2011 and 2018-2019 school years. The findings for four out of five of these variables showed that Baldwin and Jenkins Counties fared worse or about the same as other rural counties in Georgia. The only variable that showed a positive impact was the unemployment rate, which was just a bit better than the average in Baldwin County but far better than the average in Jenkins County. Baldwin County’s changes were close to the average for rural counties for every variable except for the crime variable for aggravated assault crimes which was much worse. Jenkins County’s changes were worse than the average for three of the variables, median income, children in poverty, and attendance. The only variable for Jenkins County consistent with the rural average was aggravated assault crimes. In sum, it seems these new prisons did little to affect most variables and, in some cases, negatively affected them, except for unemployment rates (See Table 3).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Differences for Baldwin/Jenkins Counties and Rural Averages\n\n\nCounty\nAssault\nIncome\nUnemployment\nPoverty\nAttendance\n\n\n\n\nBaldwin County\n+71.15\n+$302\n−7.84\n+0.12\n+0.76\n\n\nJenkins County\n−6.85\n−$8,870\n−3.84\n+19.12\n+2.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion and Policy Implications\nThis research helps to inform stakeholders in these communities about whether these prisons were a wise investment. Rural communities looking to attract new industries to their area should consider that the private prison industry may not be the best industry to pursue as the unintended effects of toxic prison culture and practices may undermine the economic stimulation intended. It also supports those working to hold private prison corporations responsible for the unintended effects of their prison business.\nThe policy implications of this project are to highlight the unintended costs of the private prison industry and the prison industrial complex as a whole. Numerous studies have shown how imprisonment can harm those incarcerated and their families. Still, this research shows that the harm is not necessarily confined to those directly affected by the penal system. The communities that are home to these facilities may also face obstacles to improved quality of life due to the presence of an industry that preys on the vulnerable and seeks profit at any cost in the name of economic stimulation and public safety.\n\n\nData Sources\nCounty Health Rankings 2010\nCounty Health Rankings 2020\nGeorgia Counties\nGeorgia Department of Corrections\nGeorgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students 2020\nGovernor’s Office of Student Achievement - Attendance Data 2011 and 2019\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement\nUnified School Districts\nUnited States Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 2010 and 2020\ndata.census.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBennett, J.

    "text": "The last decade has seen an explosion of conversations around mass incarceration. As the prison industrial complex has grown into a massive system detaining almost 2 million people in the US in 2023 (Sawyer & Wagner, 2023). It has been well documented that people of color, especially Black men, are more likely to become involved with the carceral system in the US (Eason et al., 2017; Pettit & Western, 2004; Sharkey, 2013; Simes, 2021). While race and class are inextricably intertwined, class conditions that lead to imprisonment stretch beyond the urban and racial factors usually associated with crime and subjugation (Eason et al., 2017; Pettit & Western, 2004). The removal of individuals from an already struggling community only contributes to the cycle of instability that leads to crime and harm. These individuals are fathers, workers, caregivers, and other valuable members of their community; ripping them from their families not only impacts those who may have violated the law but also those they leave behind who may have been financially or emotionally dependent on them (Gilmore, 2007).\nAs several places have made reforms to the cash bail system, including ending the practice for many charges, the impacts of these reforms are beginning to take shape. While some opponents to these changes worry that releasing individuals charged with a crime while they await trial will cause an increase in crime, there is no evidence of a correlation with increased crime rates (Preston & Eisenberg, 2022a). In fact, the opposite may be true; some places where cash bail has been largely eliminated have seen lower increases in crime than the national average or even reductions in crime when most places have seen increases due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Covert, 2022; Preston & Eisenberg, 2022b). Not only is bail reform not correlated with an increase in crime, but research also suggests that increased pretrial detention is linked with higher rates of conviction and recidivism (Gupta et al., 2016; Lowenkamp, 2022). It is important to assess not only whether unintentional negative impacts occur when policies are reformed, but it is also important to assess the nature and degree of positive impacts to advance the widespread adoption of policies that are good for people and equality.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution protects liberty and equality stating, “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” Cash bail systems violate this right by imprisoning individuals who have not been convicted of a crime simply for their inability to pay bail.\nIf the ultimate goal is to increase equality in the justice system while maintaining public safety, cash bail is impeding that goal. Detaining individuals because they are poor has a negative social and economic impact because it removes people from their families and their jobs. By reducing negative social and economic impacts, factors that contribute to poverty can be lessened or eliminated. A wealth of research exists to support the theory that poverty and inequality are positively correlated with increased crime (Fajnzylber et al., 2002; Fleisher, 1966; Freeman, 1999; Imran et al., 2018). Additionally, the issue of racial disparities in earnings is also a well-researched subject (Akee et al., 2019; Intrator et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017). Thus, it follows that removing cash bail for misdemeanors would lead to more racial and economic equality, which may lead to reduced crime and reduced harm while maintaining public safety.\n\n\nThe elimination of cash bail for misdemeanor offenses is expected to lead to a reduction in the number of guilty plea deals accepted and potentially reduce any disparity among racial groups. Using data from Harris County court records, this analysis aims to determine the change in the rate of guilty pleas before and after misdemeanor bail reform was implemented, and assess any disparity between racial groups."

    "text": "Each year, county jails similar to Harris County will spend upwards of a quarter million dollars to detain an average of around 9,000 individuals daily (Baughman, 2017). The vast majority of the people held in county jails are awaiting trial; they have not been convicted of a crime, and they are detained solely because of their inability to pay bail (Sawyer & Wagner, 2023). In addition to operation costs, detained individuals cannot work and are likely to lose employment if detained for more than a few days; this results in lost tax revenue and an increased strain on social services by their dependents (Baughman, 2017). Consistent with this cost-benefits analysis, Professor of Law and the Quattrone Center’s Academic Director Paul Heaton’s research hypothesized and confirmed millions of dollars in savings for Harris County following the implementation of misdemeanor bail reform (Heaton, 2022; heatonDownstreamConsequencesMisdemeanor2017?)."

In addition to the directly measurable cost savings of reduced detention, invisible benefits to individuals and society can be more difficult to measure. Shima Baradaran Baughman broke down different elements of detention and determined estimates for their monetary values, estimating an economic loss of approximately $153 per individual per day detained; this estimate covers the value of freedom, lost income, childcare, lost tax revenue, and welfare for dependents of detained individuals (Baughman, 2017). The average daily number of people detained pretrial in the Harris County jail from 2015 through 2019 was 8,932, of which approximately half were misdemeanors, and about half of misdemeanor charges determined a bail of over $100 (Harris County, 2023a). Additionally, individuals detained over 60 days are at increased risk of losing housing or property while detained; by filtering to only individuals with a bail above $2,500 and assuming 10% of those individuals lost housing and 20% lost property, that is an estimated annual cost of $5,707,207 (Baughman, 2017). The annual economic benefits in cost savings are estimated at around $129,470,786, increasing by 1% each year on the assumption that better economic outcomes are compounding (i.e. staying in a decent job now increases the chance of a better job in the future).\nWhile it may be difficult to assess the overall health benefits of not being detained in jail, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is known to be a common concern for formerly incarcerated individuals, and even short stints of detention can cause trauma and other psychological harms (Quandt & Jones, 2021). The cost savings accrued by not needing to address potential mental health issues like PTSD can be difficult to measure. The mean number of individuals detained in Harris County in 2017 and 2018 with a bail amount above $2,500 was 10,572 people. Multiplying one-quarter of these individuals (3,756) by $18,640, the estimated annual cost of PTSD treatment, results in an estimated savings of approximately $70,016,500 per year (DeAngelis, 2023). This is a conservative number since it does not account for other mental distress or physical harm, for which there is an increased risk in restrictive, close-quarter environments.\nThe social costs such as relationship strain and risk of assault while in detention were calculated to be approximately $95 per person per day detained, or $76,846,667 annually (Baughman, 2017). The economic, health, and social benefits are estimated at a total of $199,487,286 for the first year."

Harris County in November 2019 required the county to select an independent monitor to evaluate and ensure “accountability, transparency, and compliance with this Consent Decree consistent with the overall goals of maximizing pretrial liberty, court appearance, and public safety” (O’Donnell v. Harris County, 2019). Though the decree does not set a requirement for the number of staff needed for the independent monitor, considering the volume of cases, this analysis assumes that up to five individuals would be paid approximately the average salary of a Harris County employee, $64,278 (Harris County Salaries - Texas, 2022). The total annual cost for the independent monitor is estimated at $321,390.\nThe largest upfront cost of the implementation of this change is education and training for judges and court staff on the nuances and minutia of the decree and its conditions. The exact cost of training is difficult to estimate, but a total of 39 judges oversaw misdemeanor cases in 2017; with a general estimate of $10,000 of training per judge and their staff, the total one-time cost comes to approximately $39,000.\nThe consent decree also requires the county to provide a website for defendants to find any and all information regarding their case, including upcoming court appearances to maintain court compliance (O’Donnell v. Harris County, 2019). The current estimate for a complex website design is approximately $15,000 upfront with a high estimate of $2,000 annually for website maintenance (Carney, 2016).\nFinally, the operational costs of detention are expected to be greatly reduced resulting in cost savings for the county. Baughman estimated operating costs at approximately $83 per person per day; using the same estimate of detained misdemeanor defendants from earlier, the expected cost saving is estimated at $67,139,720, increasing by 1% each year under the assumption that less detention leads to decreased future criminal activity (Arnold Ventures, 2022; Baughman, 2017; Widra, 2022)."

Public health and safety research has found no link between detention and a decrease in crime, but there is overwhelming evidence of the harms of detention on detained individuals and their communities (Baughman, 2017; Berry & English, 2011; Digard & Swavola, 2019; Dobbie & Yang, 2021; Gius, 2018; Lowenkamp, 2022). From a utilization perspective, it is a complete waste of resources to detain individuals who are not a threat to the community instead of allowing them to await adjudication at home with their families and retain employment. Economically, the only cost of the change is a website and several new employees of the county; weighing those costs against the monetary savings of jail operation and the positive impact of retained employment and housing, the difference is vast."

Considering the benefit-cost ratio for implementation is 4.1 and the status quo is 0.0002, the county stands to save $1.3 billion over five years instead of losing $328 million.\nAssuming a 7% discount rate and a 3% inflation rate, the total discounted net benefit from a misdemeanor bail reform policy is estimated at $1.3 billion over five years. Even a conservative discount and inflation rate of 8% and 4%, respectively, estimates a discounted net benefit of $1.2 billion over five years. The baseline scenario with no change is estimated to cost $72.8 billion dollars at the 10% rate. From a purely dollars-and-cents perspective, implementation of misdemeanor bail reform is a no-brainer."

When comparing before and after full implementation at the end of 2019, an estimated 18.8 percentage point drop in the rate of guilty pleas accepted. When controlling for racial identity, this correlation does not change because there is no meaningful difference between identified races in Harris County. The confidence intervals for each of these coefficients are all negative, which concludes that predicted values for the rate of guilty pleas will be lower than before implementation (see Table 3).\nAs a robustness check, the full data of individual arrests were analyzed as well. The correlation between the probability of accepting a guilty plea before and after implementation was also negative and significant to a higher degree. The case outcome model showed an even stronger correlation that the policy lowered the probability that someone would accept a guilty plea. Additionally, the higher the bail amount the higher the probability of taking a plea deal both before and after the policy change. With each increase in the bail amount category, the probability of accepting a guilty plea increases (see Table 3).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Regression Models\n\n\n\nYear\nMonth\nMonth and Race\nCase Outcome\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n112.726***\n0.478***\n0.533***\n0.664***\n\n\n\n[76.035, 149.417]\n[0.460, 0.495]\n[0.512, 0.554]\n[0.655, 0.674]\n\n\nYear\n−0.056***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[−0.074, −0.037]\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter\n\n−0.188***\n−0.188***\n−0.212***\n\n\n\n\n[−0.216, −0.160]\n[−0.211, −0.166]\n[−0.215, −0.208]\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n−0.011\n−0.013***\n\n\n\n\n\n[−0.038, 0.016]\n[−0.017, −0.010]\n\n\nOther\n\n\n−0.154***\n−0.152***\n\n\n\n\n\n[−0.181, −0.128]\n[−0.160, −0.143]\n\n\n$5,000 & Under\n\n\n\n−0.152***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[−0.162, −0.142]\n\n\n$5,000-50,000\n\n\n\n0.124***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0.113, 0.134]\n\n\n$50,000-100,000\n\n\n\n0.279***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0.250, 0.308]\n\n\nOver $100,000\n\n\n\n0.346***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0.281, 0.411]\n\n\nN\n8\n288\n288\n337336\n\n\nR2\n0.90\n0.38\n0.60\n0.08\n\n\n\nNote:   confidence intervals in brackets  (+ p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001)"

    "text": "Public Health, Utilization, and/or Economic Impact Perspectives\n\nThe benefits of bail reform in Harris County greatly outweigh the costs from public health, utilization, and economic perspectives. Public health and safety research has found no link between detention and a decrease in crime, but there is overwhelming evidence of the harms of detention on detained individuals and their communities (Baughman, 2017; Berry & English, 2011; Digard & Swavola, 2019; Dobbie & Yang, 2021; Gius, 2018; Lowenkamp, 2022). From a utilization perspective, it is a complete waste of resources to detain individuals who are not a threat to the community instead of allowing them to await adjudication at home with their families and retain employment. Economically, the only cost of the change is a website and several new employees of the county; weighing those costs against the monetary savings of jail operation and the positive impact of retained employment and housing, the difference is vast."

    "text": "Sensitivity Analysis\n\nGiven the incredible potential economic and social benefits of reducing pretrial detention, from a dollar standpoint, this policy change is highly recommended over the baseline scenario of detaining individuals charged with a misdemeanor before trial if they lack the economic means to pay a given cash amount for bail. Considering the benefit-cost ratio for implementation is 4.1 and the status quo is 0.0002, the county stands to save $1.3 billion over five years instead of losing $328 million.\nAssuming a 7% discount rate and a 3% inflation rate, the total discounted net benefit from a misdemeanor bail reform policy is estimated at $1.3 billion over five years. Even a conservative discount and inflation rate of 8% and 4%, respectively, estimates a discounted net benefit of $1.2 billion over five years. The baseline scenario with no change is estimated to cost $72.8 billion dollars at the 10% rate. From a purely dollars-and-cents perspective, implementation of misdemeanor bail reform is a no-brainer."

The cleaned data was filtered to include only misdemeanor arrests; in the case of multiple charges, only arrests that did not include a felony charge were included. Arrests where bond was denied were also excluded from the analysis. The filtered data was summarized by year, month, and race to determine the rate of cases that resulted in a guilty plea agreement for each group and time segment. Each arrest record and each month in the summarized data was labeled to indicate if it was before or after the consent decree in November 2019. For the primary analysis, the unit of analysis is each month, and the outcome variable is the rate of guilty pleas."

While there appears to be little to no disparity between White and Black defendants, it is important to note that Hispanic ethnicity is not available in the data. Approximately 43% of Harris County identifies as Hispanic according to the 2021 American Community Survey (US Census Bureau, 2020). However, many Hispanic defendants may have been recorded as White when the police arrested them. More nuanced data about the individuals arrested is needed to say conclusively whether there is a racial disparity for people accepting guilty pleas after arrest.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Harris County Guilty Pleas by Month"

Using OLS regression models to evaluate the correlations between time (mainly before and after the change) and the rate of guilty pleas in Harris County, we can examine the trends as the policy took effect. This approach also allows us to control for racial identity as it relates to case outcomes. For this analysis, race is divided into three categories: White, Black, and Other. Notably, the data does not include ethnicity, and individuals who identify as Hispanic are likely classified as White. As a robustness check, the case outcomes for all arrests individually are also assessed controlling for the bail amount for each case.

When comparing before and after full implementation at the end of 2019, an estimated 18.8 percentage point drop in the rate of guilty pleas accepted. When controlling for racial identity, this correlation does not change because there is no meaningful difference between identified races in Harris County. The confidence intervals for each of these coefficients are all negative, which concludes that predicted values for the rate of guilty pleas will be lower than before implementation (see Table 3).\nAs a robustness check, the full data of individual arrests were analyzed as well. The correlation between the probability of accepting a guilty plea before and after implementation was also negative and significant to a higher degree. The case outcome model showed an even stronger correlation that the policy lowered the probability that someone would accept a guilty plea. Additionally, the higher the bail amount the higher the probability of taking a plea deal both before and after the policy change. With each increase in the bail amount category, the probability of accepting a guilty plea increases (see Table 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Regression Models\n\n\n\nYear\nMonth\nMonth and Race\nCase Outcome\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n112.726***\n0.478***\n0.533***\n0.664***\n\n\n\n[76.035, 149.417]\n[0.460, 0.495]\n[0.512, 0.554]\n[0.655, 0.674]\n\n\nYear\n−0.056***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[−0.074, −0.037]\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter\n\n−0.188***\n−0.188***\n−0.212***\n\n\n\n\n[−0.216, −0.160]\n[−0.211, −0.166]\n[−0.215, −0.208]\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n−0.011\n−0.013***\n\n\n\n\n\n[−0.038, 0.016]\n[−0.017, −0.010]\n\n\nOther\n\n\n−0.154***\n−0.152***\n\n\n\n\n\n[−0.181, −0.128]\n[−0.160, −0.143]\n\n\n$5,000 & Under\n\n\n\n−0.152***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[−0.162, −0.142]\n\n\n$5,000-50,000\n\n\n\n0.124***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0.113, 0.134]\n\n\n$50,000-100,000\n\n\n\n0.279***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0.250, 0.308]\n\n\nOver $100,000\n\n\n\n0.346***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0.281, 0.411]\n\n\nN\n8\n288\n288\n337336\n\n\nR2\n0.90\n0.38\n0.60\n0.08\n\n\n\nNote:   confidence intervals in brackets  (+ p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001)"

Other than race, class is the next predominant factor that has been addressed by previous research; while race and class are inextricably intertwined, class conditions that lead to imprisonment stretch beyond the urban and racial factors usually associated with crime and subjugation (Eason et al., 2017; Pettit & Western, 2004). Outside of racial and economic barriers to care, Black Americans face cultural barriers and stigma surrounding seeking mental health care (Snowden, 2001).\nPeople in jails and prisons are more likely than the general population to suffer from a serious mental health issue, and the carceral system does the bare minimum to provide resources and health care to these individuals while they are incarcerated, let alone before and after their imprisonment (Cloud, 2014). The availability of mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment for individuals who may be a risk to the community, as an alternative to imprisonment has more potential to increase public safety and the well-being of communities."

The obvious demographic and socioeconomic factors should be considered and potentially controlled in many analyses. Investigating spatial relationships to evaluate dimensions of the accessibility, in terms of distance and capacity, to mental health facilities. While there are many dimensions to the concept of accessibility, distance can be a useful indicator of at least when mental health care options are not available. The inpatient and daily capacities of urban facilities may reveal a different aspect of accessibility, especially in densely populated areas. Other dimensions to consider might be specific services provided, populations served, payment methods accepted, and outreach or awareness of services available. This analysis focuses on the dimensions of proximity and capacity as indicators of access to mental health care, specifically inpatient care for emergency situations. Tracts with a higher proportion of Black residents are predicted to have higher imprisonment rates, and median income is likely to be negatively related to imprisonment rates. In rural areas, proximity is expected to have a stronger positive correlation with imprisonment, whereas we anticipate capacity to be more negatively influential in urban areas."

As described above, this variable was calculated by the Prison Policy Initiative and comes from administrative data made available by policies ending the practice of prison gerrymandering in Maryland (Redistricting Data, 2020; Widra, 2023). Using census tracts as the unit of analysis and GIS to determine the distance to the nearest mental health facility with various characteristics, including inpatient care and crisis intervention services, we can measure a dimension of accessibility of mental health care, particularly during a crisis to avoid involving law enforcement.\nThe independent variables are grouped into two categories: established indicators, demographic and socioeconomic factors known to be associated with imprisonment and involvement with the criminal justice system, and our primary explanatory variables measure the distance in miles and minutes between the geographical center of each tract and the nearest facility. See ?@tbl-vars for the specific variables and the source of the data for each.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary explanatory variables are divided into three groups, (1) mental health facilities, (2) facilities with inpatient care, and (3) inpatient facilities with crisis intervention services. Within each group, two measures for each type of facility have been calculated, (a) travel time in minutes (at 9:00 AM on a weekday) and (b) driving distance in miles (see ?@tbl-vars2).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.justify}\nBecause urban areas are likely to have a shorter distance to a facility due to proximity to a city, the capacity of urban facilities may be more critical to determining the accessibility of these services when they are needed. However, mental health facilities are not transparent or forthcoming about the details of their capacity and services with the public, and these data were not able to be obtained for this research. It is important to note that within the city of Baltimore, Maryland’s largest urban area (which contains the highest rates of imprisonment), there is only one inpatient facility according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in 2021. The single inpatient facility in Baltimore city does not offer crisis intervention services. Even without exact numbers, it is highly likely that one facility does not have enough capacity to serve a city with more than half a million residents, let alone a city with a reputation for crime and police violence."

    "text": "As the Prison Industrial Complex (PIC) has expanded, scholars have examined the relationship between place and imprisonment in terms of places with high rates of reported crime, places with an overwhelming police presence, and the experiences of people in those communities and their relationship with the criminal justice system. The removal of individuals from an already struggling community only contributes to the cycle of instability that leads to crime and harm. These individuals are fathers, workers, caregivers, and other valuable members of their community; ripping them from their families not only impacts those who may have violated the law but also those they leave behind who may have been financially or emotionally dependent on them (Gilmore, 2007). A number of alternative measures have been proposed against mass incarceration, including the legalization of marijuana, the repeal of discriminatory “tough on crime” laws, and drug courts and other treatment programs (Braun, 2019; Porter, 2022). This research focuses on a different approach to the problem of mass incarceration—access to mental health, specifically inpatient care and crisis intervention. While this may not be a fully causal analysis, the association between access to mental health care and imprisonment rates combined with medical research about violent behavior and mental health care may provide insights about potential areas in need of these types of resources.\nAny analysis of the PIC should include an examination of the demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with high imprisonment rates. The analysis of these relationships provides context about the harm caused by the PIC and that harm may be compounded by issues of access to mental health care and its relationship with imprisonment rates. This evaluation focuses on place-based implications of access to mental health care and imprisonment using two dimensions of access—proximity in travel time and capacity of the nearest facility as it is related to population density. By exploring the availability of care and the characteristics of census tracts, insights can be gained about areas in need of more resources for mental health accessibility to improve outcomes for communities overly impacted by an oppressive carceral system. Considering these spatial characteristics along with standard factors and existing research may illuminate an unexplored piece of the greater influence of oppressive policies that fuel the Prison Industrial Complex as a whole.\n\n\nIt has been well documented that people of color, especially Black men, are more likely to become involved with the carceral system in the US (Eason et al., 2017; Pettit & Western, 2004; Sharkey, 2013; Simes, 2021). Other than race, class is the next predominant factor that has been addressed by previous research; while race and class are inextricably intertwined, class conditions that lead to imprisonment stretch beyond the urban and racial factors usually associated with crime and subjugation (Eason et al., 2017; Pettit & Western, 2004). Outside of racial and economic barriers to care, Black Americans face cultural barriers and stigma surrounding seeking mental health care (Snowden, 2001).\nPeople in jails and prisons are more likely than the general population to suffer from a serious mental health issue, and the carceral system does the bare minimum to provide resources and health care to these individuals while they are incarcerated, let alone before and after their imprisonment (Cloud, 2014). The availability of mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment for individuals who may be a risk to the community, as an alternative to imprisonment has more potential to increase public safety and the well-being of communities.\n\n\n\nPrison gerrymandering is the practice of counting imprisoned people as residents of the place where they are imprisoned. The US Census defines residence as “where [people] live and sleep most of the time” (US Census Bureau, 2018). However, incarcerated people cannot vote or participate in the community where they are detained, and they often maintain ties to their community of origin and hope to have a future there when they return. The practice of counting these people as part of a community in which they have no role not only boosts representation for people around a prison but siphons resources and representation from their home communities (Benveniste, 2022). Representatives in rural areas often lobby for new prisons in their district for the very reason of redirecting resources to their own constituents (Huling, 2002). Prisons are often far from the urban centers where most prisoners lived before incarceration. However, the main focus of this analysis is on how the PIC not only takes people out of their communities but also removes their citizenship in their home neighborhoods in matters that determine resource allocation and representation. Policies like these continue the legacy of attitudes about some individuals counting as only three-fifths of a citizen.. As more people are pulled away from their homes and counted in a place that does not value their interests, the barriers to opportunity are reinforced, and the cycle of subjugation continues.\nAs of 2021, about a dozen states had ended prison gerrymandering which would impact the redistricting from the 2020 Census (Fenster, 2021). Through the administrative process of this policy change, data have been made available about precisely where people in prison are from, and where they intend to return to (Widra, 2023). This information is valuable and unique because it provides a link to determine the conditions that both create an environment where people feel the need to imprison larger portions of the population and create nuanced solutions to reduce both the harm that leads to imprisonment and the harm caused by it.\n\n\n\nMental health care is an important resource to ensure overall health and quality of life (Prince et al., 2007). The expansion of mental health care in the last few decades has been a response to a dire crisis that has long been ignored and stigmatized, and the benefits of access and awareness of mental health services are obvious to many who have utilized these services (Horton, 2007). Though access to mental health services is generally regarded as a positive influence on communities, the marginalized groups who often lack access to these services are the same communities that are targeted for high crime and imprisonment rates (Saxena et al., 2007). The link between access to mental health care, crime, and imprisonment is worth investigating to advocate for more resources to be made available for these communities and potentially prevent crime and harm before they happen, and as a result, reduce unnecessary imprisonment.\nBarriers to accessing mental health services exist in a variety of forms—awareness, affordability, and availability. The availability component is the focus of this analysis; availability includes the capacity of nearby facilities and proximity to facilities. While there may be a higher density of facilities in urban areas, compared to the populations in those areas, resources may not be available to individuals in need. Long waiting lists, staffing shortages, and a general lack of funding and resources for behavioral health are the result of health and public policy prioritizing more lucrative ventures (Butryn et al., 2017). Proximity to services may add to the issue of availability; especially in low-income rural areas, many people may not have the resources or time to travel long distances for preventative care, and facilities may be too far away to be able to adequately respond to crisis situations, leading law enforcement to fill that role.\nThree major components of mental health care and its relationship with imprisonment have been discussed: mental health care as prevention, mental health care for families and individuals impacted by the imprisonment of a loved one, and mental health care for formerly imprisoned residents upon release. Mental health care as prevention of criminal and violent behavior has been discussed in medical journals, but the evaluation of access to care in high imprisonment areas may provide important insights about reducing harm, both in terms of crime rates and imprisonment itself (Brennan et al., 2000; Hodgins et al., 2005; Petras et al., 2008). Increased access to mental health care, especially on a large scale could lead to an overall reduction in violent and aggressive behavior, which comprises most of the crime residents are most concerned about.\n\n\n\nWith new information available about the home locations of imprisoned people, there are a number of relationships to investigate. The obvious demographic and socioeconomic factors should be considered and potentially controlled in many analyses. Investigating spatial relationships to evaluate dimensions of the accessibility, in terms of distance and capacity, to mental health facilities. While there are many dimensions to the concept of accessibility, distance can be a useful indicator of at least when mental health care options are not available. The inpatient and daily capacities of urban facilities may reveal a different aspect of accessibility, especially in densely populated areas. Other dimensions to consider might be specific services provided, populations served, payment methods accepted, and outreach or awareness of services available. This analysis focuses on the dimensions of proximity and capacity as indicators of access to mental health care, specifically inpatient care for emergency situations. Tracts with a higher proportion of Black residents are predicted to have higher imprisonment rates, and median income is likely to be negatively related to imprisonment rates. In rural areas, proximity is expected to have a stronger positive correlation with imprisonment, whereas we anticipate capacity to be more negatively influential in urban areas.\n\n\n\n\nThe data for this analysis comes from four different sources combined to create a versatile basis for geographic analysis of imprisonment and its relationship with location. The imprisonment data is from Prison Policy Initiative, a non-profit organization working to “expose the broader harm of mass criminalization” through data and research (Prison Policy Initiative, n.d.). The demographic data for the same census tracts is publicly available from the US Census Bureau (Census Bureau Data, 2020). Information about mental health facilities is available from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Though the department provides data about many different aspects of mental health treatment and services, since this analysis is focused on the geography of imprisonment, the 2020 National Directory Of Mental Health Treatment Facilities contains locations and key characteristics for all facilities in the US (SAMHSA, 2020). Finally, the American Community Survey hosts geographic and demographic data at the census tract level that is available publicly. This data was used to map the previous data geographically and perform spatial analysis (Esri, 2020).\n\n\nThe data gathered from the Prison Policy Initiative is cross-sectional data using 2020 Census and Maryland state data. The data originated as administrative data from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and was combined with population data from the Census. The Prison Policy Initiative collected, calculated, and combined this data for public use for various levels of geography for Maryland and eleven other states where prison gerrymandering has been overruled. The imprisonment rate used the redistricting data from Maryland’s law ending prison gerrymandering to count prisoners as residents of their home neighborhoods instead of the location of the prison (Redistricting Data, 2020; Widra, 2023).\nThis new data can be used to identify what characteristics are common among places with high imprisonment rates. Combined with demographic data about these locations and the proximity of mental health resources, this data can highlight areas in need of more mental health resources to reduce the harm caused by imprisonment and over-policing. The abolition of prison gerrymandering is still ongoing, so this data is only available in limited locations. However, it can be used to shed light on the issue of prison gerrymandering and identify the common circumstances of places with high imprisonment rates.\n\n\n\nThe US Census collects cross-sectional data every ten years and makes it available publicly. Though the Census collects data about many different attributes at the individual and household level, the data for this analysis is aggregated to the census tract level. Four datasets were acquired from the online Census repository (Census Bureau Data, 2020). In combination with the imprisonment data, the census data can show correlations between the racial and socioeconomic characteristics of an area and the rate of imprisonment and help to conceptualize the systematic ways that incarceration and the Prison Industrial Complex as a whole impact people of color and low-income communities disproportionately.\n\n\n\nWithin the US Department of Health and Human Services, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration collects and provides data about a wide array of treatments, services, and facilities for mental health and substance abuse (SAMHSA, 2020). The data used for this specific analysis contains geographic and key characteristics of mental health facilities in Maryland. While some of these facilities also provide substance abuse treatment, facilities that exclusively provide substance abuse treatment are not included in this directory. The information about each facility is collected by a survey at the facility level; many data points are collected in the survey about specific treatments and capacities, but the information provided with geographic information in this directory only contained basic characteristics about the type of care, settings, operation, payments accepted, populations served, and others. The locations and services provided by each facility can demonstrate how access and proximity may be related to the rate of imprisonment in a community.\n\n\n\nThe American Community Survey (ACS) continuously collects data about many different variables to create estimates about the social, economic, and demographic characteristics of different communities. The Context for Emergency Response feature layer contains information about factors that relate to emergency response including the amount of the population without health insurance, internet access at home, or a personal vehicle. The spatial data for the census tracts will be used to determine the distance to different types of mental health facilities (Esri, 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dependent variable is the imprisonment rate per 100,000 residents for each census tract in Maryland. As described above, this variable was calculated by the Prison Policy Initiative and comes from administrative data made available by policies ending the practice of prison gerrymandering in Maryland (Redistricting Data, 2020; Widra, 2023). Using census tracts as the unit of analysis and GIS to determine the distance to the nearest mental health facility with various characteristics, including inpatient care and crisis intervention services, we can measure a dimension of accessibility of mental health care, particularly during a crisis to avoid involving law enforcement.\nThe independent variables are grouped into two categories: established indicators, demographic and socioeconomic factors known to be associated with imprisonment and involvement with the criminal justice system, and our primary explanatory variables measure the distance in miles and minutes between the geographical center of each tract and the nearest facility. See ?@tbl-vars for the specific variables and the source of the data for each.\n\n\n\nThe primary explanatory variables are divided into three groups, (1) mental health facilities, (2) facilities with inpatient care, and (3) inpatient facilities with crisis intervention services. Within each group, two measures for each type of facility have been calculated, (a) travel time in minutes (at 9:00 AM on a weekday) and (b) driving distance in miles (see ?@tbl-vars2).\n\n\n\nBecause urban areas are likely to have a shorter distance to a facility due to proximity to a city, the capacity of urban facilities may be more critical to determining the accessibility of these services when they are needed. However, mental health facilities are not transparent or forthcoming about the details of their capacity and services with the public, and these data were not able to be obtained for this research. It is important to note that within the city of Baltimore, Maryland’s largest urban area (which contains the highest rates of imprisonment), there is only one inpatient facility according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in 2021. The single inpatient facility in Baltimore city does not offer crisis intervention services. Even without exact numbers, it is highly likely that one facility does not have enough capacity to serve a city with more than half a million residents, let alone a city with a reputation for crime and police violence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Layer 1:} & Y_{ij} | \\mu_j, \\sigma_y \\sim \\text{model of how imprisonment varies WITHIN counties } j \\\\\n\\text{Layer 2:} & \\mu_j | \\mu, \\sigma_\\mu \\sim \\text{model of how the typical imprisonment $\\mu_j$ varies BETWEEN counties.} \\\\\n\\text{Layer 3:} & \\mu, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_\\mu \\sim \\text{prior models for shared global parameters} \\\\\n\\\\\ni = & \\text{Tract} \\\\\nj = & \\text{County} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nY_{ij} | \\beta_{0j}, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\beta_4, \\sigma_y \\sim N(\\mu_{ij}, \\sigma_y^2) \\;\\; \\text{ with } \\;\\;  \\mu_{ij} =& \\beta_{0j} + \\\\\n&\\beta_1\\text{Percent Black}_{ij} + \\\\\n&\\beta_2\\text{Median Income}_{ij} + \\\\\n&\\beta_3\\text{Unemployment Rate}_{ij} + \\\\\n&\\beta_4\\text{Urban}_{ij} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\beta_{0j} | \\beta_0, \\sigma_0  \\stackrel{ind}{\\sim} & N(\\beta_0, \\sigma_0^2) \\\\\n\\beta_{0c}  \\sim & N(100, 10^2) \\\\\n\\beta_1 \\sim & N(100, 60) \\\\\n\\beta_2 \\sim & N(-50, 15) \\\\\n\\beta_3 \\sim & N(100, 25) \\\\\n\\beta_4 \\sim & N(100, 25) \\\\\n\\sigma \\sim & \\text{Exp}(l) \\\\\n\\sigma_y \\sim & \\text{Exp}(0.072) \\\\\n\\sigma_0 \\sim & \\text{Exp}(1) \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nY_{ij} | \\beta_{0j}, \\beta_5, \\sigma_y \\sim N(\\mu_{ij}, \\sigma_y^2) \\;\\; \\text{ with } \\;\\;  \\mu_{ij} =& \\beta_{0j} + \\\\\n&\\beta_5\\text{Distance to Facility}_{ij} + \\\\\n\\\\\nY_{ij} | \\beta_{0j}, \\beta_4, \\beta_5, \\sigma_y \\sim N(\\mu_{ij}, \\sigma_y^2) \\;\\; \\text{ with } \\;\\;  \\mu_{ij} =& \\beta_{0j} + \\\\\n&\\beta_4\\text{Urban}_{ij} \\\\\n&\\beta_5\\text{Distance to Facility}_{ij} \\\\\n\\\\\nY_{ij} | \\beta_{0j}, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\beta_4, \\beta_5, \\sigma_y \\sim N(\\mu_{ij}, \\sigma_y^2) \\;\\; \\text{ with } \\;\\;  \\mu_{ij} =& \\beta_{0j} + \\\\\n&\\beta_1\\text{Percent Black}_{ij} + \\\\\n&\\beta_2\\text{Median Income}_{ij} + \\\\\n&\\beta_3\\text{Unemployment Rate}_{ij} + \\\\\n&\\beta_4\\text{Urban}_{ij} \\\\\n&\\beta_5\\text{Distance to Facility}_{ij} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\beta_{0j} | \\beta_0, \\sigma_0  \\stackrel{ind}{\\sim} & N(\\beta_0, \\sigma_0^2) \\\\\n\\beta_{0c}  \\sim & N(100, 10^2) \\\\\n\\beta_1 \\sim & N(100, 60) \\\\\n\\beta_2 \\sim & N(-50, 15) \\\\\n\\beta_3 \\sim & N(100, 25) \\\\\n\\beta_4 \\sim & N(-100, 35) \\\\\n\\beta_5 \\sim & N(100, 25) \\\\\n\\sigma \\sim & \\text{Exp}(l) \\\\\n\\sigma_y \\sim & \\text{Exp}(0.072) \\\\\n\\sigma_0 \\sim & \\text{Exp}(1) \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith all the variables together in one dataset, census tracts and mental health facilities can be compared using a variety of characteristics. Not only is the final dataset free of missing values and unusual census tracts, the analytic dataset has various general characteristics for each tract. Each tract is also linked to the closest mental health facilities offering several specific services. The census tract FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) codes remain in the dataset so additional variable can easily be added. Instead of several datasets in different formats with specific information, the full and unique dataset can now help describe different characteristics and dimensions of high rates of imprisonment.\n\n\nCensus Tract Characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Tract Characteristics\n    \n    \n    \n      Variable\n      Mean\n      Median\n      Std Dev\n      Min\n      Max\n    \n  \n  \n    Imprisonment Rate per 100,000\n314\n139\n497\n0\n3,767\n    Total Population\n4,104\n3,911\n1,603\n776\n11,509\n    Median Income\n$107,055\n$101,406\n$44,815\n$14,464\n$250,001\n    % Black\n31.0%\n18.5%\n30.2%\n0.0%\n99.7%\n    % Under Poverty Level\n10.0%\n7.3%\n9.1%\n0.0%\n67.5%\n    Unemployment Rate\n5.5%\n4.5%\n3.9%\n0.0%\n31.2%\n    % Rural\n14.9%\n0.0%\n32.1%\n0.0%\n100%\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean\nMedian\nStd.Dev\nMin\nMax\n\n\n\n\nImprisonment Rate per 100,000\n314\n139\n497\n0\n3,767\n\n\nTotal Population\n4,104\n3,911\n1,603\n776\n11,509\n\n\nMedian Income\n$107,055\n$101,406\n$44,815\n$14,464\n$250,001\n\n\n% Black\n31.0%\n18.5%\n30.2%\n0.0%\n99.7%\n\n\n% Under Poverty Level\n10.0%\n7.3%\n9.1%\n0.0%\n67.5%\n\n\nUnemployment Rate\n5.5%\n4.5%\n3.9%\n0.0%\n31.2%\n\n\n% Rural\n14.9%\n0.0%\n32.1%\n0.0%\n100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?@tbl-sumMD1 summarizes some key variables regarding census tract characteristics in the new dataset. The median income across all tracts in Maryland was $101,406, compared to a national median income of $62,529. The average percentage of Black residents for each tract was 31.0%, compared to only 11.2% nationwide. As a midatlantic state, tracts in Maryland have a lower percentage of rural housing than the national average by about half, 14.9% and 27%, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this complete analytic dataset, visualizing the primary variables, imprisonment rate and inpatient mental health facilities, on a map provides some preliminary context for greater research questions. The map of imprisonment rates in Maryland, shown in ?@fig-map1, highlights the concentration of high imprisonment in the Baltimore urban area. Since Baltimore is the largest urban area entirely in Maryland, it is not unexpected to see higher rates of imprisonment in the city and surrounding areas. However, the suburbs of Washington, D.C. are also partially in Maryland with comparable population density, but the imprisonment rate for those areas are much lower than the Baltimore suburbs. Though rural areas outside of the two major metropolitan areas seem to have lower rates of imprisonment overall, the southeast peninsula and northwest panhandle seem to have surprisingly higher rates. From this map, it seems that these areas are further from inpatient facilities, and the few in those areas may not have sufficient capacity for the large areas they serve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpectedly, the common indicators of inequality have a significant relationship with imprisonment rates. Median income, percentage of Black people in the population, percentage of the population with at least a bachelor’s degree, and the unemployment rate are all strongly and significantly related to high imprisonment. As educational attainment and income rise, the expected imprisonment rate falls, and as the percentage of the population that is Black and the unemployment rate rises, so does the expected imprisonment rate. Even when controlling for all of these factors, each has a significant correlation with the rate of imprisonment (see ?@tbl-regress1).\n\n\n\nSince Maryland does contain at least part of two major metropolitan areas, separating out the rural areas can provide insights into how relationships might change outside the city and how to plan and implement policies that target the needs of that type of community. However, ?@tbl-regress2 shows that the same tract characteristics are still significantly related to imprisonment rates, but with slightly lower numbers.\n\n\n\nThe crucial addition to this collection of census tract characteristics is the proximity to mental health facilities. As discussed earlier, access to mental health care, and specifically inpatient care when someone is in crisis, is not only an alternative to imprisonment, it may even prevent future harm and repair issues that can lead to criminal behavior. ?@tbl-regress3 shows little or even the opposite effect overall, but by isolating rural areas the relationship between distance and imprisonment is significant and positive, especially for inpatient facilities with crisis intervention or accepting walk-ins.\n\n\n\nLooking at all the models side-by-side in ?@tbl-regressALL, even controlling for the tract characteristics from ?@tbl-regress1 and ?@tbl-regress2, distance to facilities with crisis intervention has a significant relationship with imprisonment. Without accessibility to emergency mental health treatment, people in crisis are more likely to end up arrested, or worse, if police are the only option to de-escalate the situation.\nBecause urban tracts are overrepresented and more likely to be spatially close to a facility, the relationship is not clear, However, this does not account for capacity at urban facilities. According to the National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS): 2020, the average capacity of facilities across Maryland is 44 beds for inpatient clients (slightly lower than the national average of 49) (samhsaNationalMentalHealth2020?). Even assuming the facilities in Baltimore have a higher capacity than average, it is unlikely the four inpatient facilities within Baltimore City are equipped to adequately provide care to the city’s nearly half a million population. The map from ?@fig-map1 highlights that Baltimore has the highest concentration of high imprisonment rates in Maryland, but few facilities offering inpatient care for a large and densely populated area.\n\n\n\nThroughout the state of Maryland, race and income are both strongly correlated with imprisonment rates. Race and income also have a strong relationship with each other. ?@fig-race1 visualizes the relationship between income, race, and imprisonment; the vertical and horizontal lines indicate the median income and average imprisonment for tracts with a majority Black population and those without a majority (though not necessarily a majority White population). Almost all the tracts below the median income for tracts with a Black majority are above average for imprisonment. It is also notable that the median and mean for these variables are quite different for each group. Not only is the racial income disparity obvious, but that disparity can lead to higher rates of imprisonment, adding a huge obstacle to economic success in already struggling communities.\nWhile proximity to mental health care appears to be a bigger issue for rural areas, which may still be low-income but less likely to have a majority of Black residents, imprisonment is still an important issue in these communities. Especially in the Baltimore area, the percentage of Black residents is highly associated with high imprisonment. ?@fig-map2 zooms in on two areas of Maryland with a high concentration of Black communities, the Washington D.C. suburbs and the Baltimore urban area. The darkest colors on the map indicate a high percentage of Black population and high imprisonment; the bright colors indicate that one is high but the other is low; the lightest colors indicate that both are low. In the D.C. suburbs there are some pockets that have high imprisonment, but many tracks with large Black populations, but relatively low imprisonment. However, in Baltimore, almost the entire area is high in both measures. It is worth investigating reasons the DC suburbs are not experiencing the level of imprisonment as in and around Baltimore, but that is outside the scope of this research.\n\n\n\nOutside urban areas, distance to inpatient mental health facilities is significantly associated with imprisonment rates. ?@fig-map3 shows the areas of Maryland with long travel times to inpatient facilities with crisis intervention and high imprisonment rates. As expected and explained earlier, the urban areas may be close and still have high imprisonment rates. But the southeast area has high travel times and high imprisonment but is not near a major city. This is an area where proximity is likely to play a larger role in accessibility and would be an area worth investing in more mental health resources. fig-MHF plots the relationship between driving distance and imprisonment rate; the lighter lines indicate the means for tracts that are not majority White (the diamond points), and the darker lines indicate means for tracts with a majority White population (circle points). In rural tracts, proximity to inpatient care seems to lower imprisonment rates for non-majority white communities.\nProximity to mental health care can not only prevent harmful criminal behavior, but it can also serve as an alternative for dangerous situations before they become criminal actions. Untreated mental health issues can put someone in a crisis, and without the tools to respond to that crisis, the person suffering and others can be in danger. If the only resource available is the police, who may not even be trained or equipped to confront a person experiencing a mental health crisis, there is a higher chance that the situation will either harm the person in crisis, others, or both. No one calls an electrician when a toilet overflows, why would you want to call the police when you need a doctor? Either no one is called and the person may become desperate and turn to illegal activity, or the police are called and unable to de-escalate the situation resulting in arrest, incarceration, or even death.\nMental health accessibility is also important for formerly incarcerated people returning to their communities to heal from the trauma of imprisonment and become capable of reintegrating and supporting their community. Prison is a traumatizing place, and some people spend many years locked up for minor, non-violent offenses but endure years of violence and trauma from other inmates and staff, and they may be more in need of mental health care than ever before. Communities experiencing high rates of imprisonment need investment in mental health, not only for prevention, but for rehabilitation as well.\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss limitations, further research, and policy implications.\n\n\nData needed about capacity — Four inpatient facilities may be in close proximity to Baltimore residents, but capacity may be the issue in urban areas.\n\n\n\nLack of health insurance for formerly imprisoned residents as a barrier to access mental health care.\n\n\n\nMaryland tracts with nearest facilities and all characteristics\nMaryland tracts with nearest facilities and select characteristics\nMaryland facilities list with all characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding emergency mental health care to divert people in need of health care away from the carceral system both through prevention and treatment.\nMany violent conflicts require de-escalation and treatment, not confinement.\nFunding and supporting mental health care accessibility can enable people to receive the health care and resources they need instead of becoming entrenched in the endless cycle of incarceration and harm from the Prison Industrial Complex and all its extremities."

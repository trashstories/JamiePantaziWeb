  abstract = {Using unique linked data, we examine income inequality and mobility across racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Our data encompass the universe of income tax filers in the United States for the period 2000–2014, matched with individual-level race and ethnicity information from multiple censuses and American Community Survey data. We document both income inequality and mobility trends over the period. We find significant stratification in terms of average incomes by racial/ethnic group and distinct differences in within-group income inequality. The groups with the highest incomes—whites and Asians—also have the highest levels of within-group inequality and the lowest levels of within-group mobility. The reverse is true for the lowest-income groups: blacks, American Indians, and Hispanics have lower within-group inequality and immobility. On the other hand, low-income groups are also highly immobile in terms of overall, rather than within-group, mobility. These same groups also have a higher probability of experiencing downward mobility compared with whites and Asians. We also find that within-group income inequality increased for all groups between 2000 and 2014, and the increase was especially large for whites. The picture that emerges from our analysis is of a rigid income structure, with mainly whites and Asians positioned at the top and blacks, American Indians, and Hispanics confined to the bottom.},

  abstract = {Over 20 percent of prison and jail inmates in the United States are currently awaiting trial, but little is known about the impact of pretrial detention on defendants. This paper uses the detention tendencies of quasi-randomly assigned bail judges to estimate the causal effects of pretrial detention on subsequent defendant outcomes. Using data from administrative court and tax records, we find that pretrial detention significantly increases the probability of conviction, primarily through an increase in guilty pleas. Pretrial detention has no net effect on future crime, but decreases formal sector employment and the receipt of employment- and tax-related government benefits. These results are consistent with (i) pretrial detention weakening defendants' bargaining positions during plea negotiations and (ii) a criminal conviction lowering defendants' prospects in the formal labor market.

First, we study the correlation between the Gini index and homicide and robbery rates within and between countries. Second, we examine the partial correlation by considering other crime determinants. Third, we control for the endogeneity of inequality by isolating its exogenous impact on these crime rates. Fourth, we control for measurement error in crime rates by modeling it as both unobserved country effects and random noise. Finally, we examine the robustness of this partial correlation to alternative measures of inequality. The panel data consist of nonoverlapping 5-year averages for 39 countries during 1965–95 for homicides and 37 countries during 1970–94 for robberies. Crime rates and inequality are positively correlated within countries and, particularly, between countries, and this correlation reflects causation from inequality to crime rates, even after controlling for other crime determinants.},

  abstract = {Crime is a major activity in the US, with implications for poverty and the allocation of public and private resources. The economics of crime focuses on the effect of incentives on criminal behavior, the way decisions interact in a market setting; and the use of a benefit-cost framework to assess alternative strategies to reduce crime. This essay shows that most empirical evidence supports the role of incentives in the criminal decision: legitimate labor market experiences, sanctions including incarceration, and the risk of apprehension all influence decisions to engage in crime. By putting crime into a market setting, economic analysis highlights the difficulty of reducing crime through incapacitation: when the elasticity of supply to crime is high, one criminal replaces another in the market; and thus the importance of deterring crime by altering behavior. Most analyses show that "crime pays" in the sense of offering higher wages than legitimate work, presumably in part to offset the risk of apprehension. But some important facts about crime - long term trend increases and decreases; the geographic concentration of crime; the preponderance of men and the young in crime - seem to go beyond basic economic analysis. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Multilevel cross-sectional logistic regression analyses were conducted using data from waves I and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 12,752 respondents). Results showed significantly higher likelihood of having ever been arrested among blacks, when compared to whites, even after controlling for a range of delinquent behaviors (odds ratio = 1.58, 95 \% confidence interval = 1.27, 1.95). These black–white disparities were no longer present after accounting for racial composition of the neighborhood, supporting the growing body of research demonstrating the importance of contextual variables in driving disproportionate minority contact with the justice system.},

Using a large sample of criminal cases in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, we analyze the consequences of the money bail system by exploiting the variation in bail-setting tendencies among randomly assigned bail judges. Our estimates suggest that the assignment of money bail leads to a 12 percent increase in the likelihood of conviction and a 6–9 percent increase in recidivism. Our results highlight the importance of credit constraints in shaping defendant outcomes and point to important fairness considerations in the institutional design of the American money bail system.},

  abstract = {In misdemeanor cases, pretrial detention poses a particular problem because it may induce innocent defendants to plead guilty in order to exit jail, potentially creating widespread error in case adjudication. While practitioners have long recognized this possibility, empirical evidence on the downstream impacts of pretrial detention on misdemeanor defendants and their cases remains limited. This Article uses detailed data on hundreds of thousands of misdemeanor cases resolved in Harris County, Texas—the thirdlargest county in the United States—to measure the effects of pretrial detention on case outcomes and future crime. We find that detained defendants are 25\% more likely than similarly situated releasees to plead guilty, are 43\% more likely to be sentenced to jail, and receive jail sentences that are more than twice as long on average. Furthermore, those detained pretrial are more likely to commit future crimes, which suggests that detention may have a criminogenic effect. These differences persist even after fully controlling for the initial bail amount, offense, demographic information, and criminal history characteristics. Use of more limited sets of controls, as in prior research, overstates the adverse impacts of detention. A quasi-experimental analysis based on case timing confirms that these differences likely reflect the causal effect of detention. These results raise important constitutional questions and suggest that Harris County could save millions of dollars per year, increase public safety, and reduce wrongful convictions with better pretrial release policy.},

However, the income payoffs are much lower for African Americans than other groups, especially Asians. Although Hispanics and Asians have always displayed declining levels of minority-white dissimilarity and rising levels of minority-white interaction with rising income, income differentials on these outcomes for blacks did not appear until 1990 and since then have improved at a very slow pace. Given their higher overall levels of segregation and income's limited effect on residential attainment, African Americans experience less integration, more neighborhood poverty at all levels of income compared to other minority groups. The degree of black spatial disadvantage is especially acute in the nation's 21 hypersegregated metropolitan areas.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to better understand the experiences and perceptions of incarcerated and released pretrial defendants on the bail process, and in particular on the use of money for release. Potential collateral consequences and concepts of procedural justice were also explored. Method: Self-report data were collected through brief surveys conducted by pretrial defendants with the option of posting a money bond in four jail facilities (220 individuals), and pretrial released defendants in four pretrial supervision agencies (146 individuals) across three states (366 total). Surveys were customized based on detained versus released defendant status, and analyses were presented separately for each group. Findings: Jail pretrial defendants: We found that the majority of the incarcerated pretrial defendants were being held on low-level bonds (below \$5,000), and most participants had been incarcerated for over a month. The most common reason participants noted not posting bond was that they could not afford it, followed by their families could not afford it, although additional reasons not originally listed in the survey emerged as well. Retaining employment appears to be a significant potential collateral consequence for incarcerated defendants, with the vast majority believing they may lose their job. Finally, as the bond amount increased, perceptions of procedural justice decreased for this group. Released pretrial defendants: The majority of released pretrial defendants were released on a money bond, with the majority of money bonds being between \$1,001 and \$5,000. Most participants on pretrial supervision had been incarcerated for between 1 to 3 days, inclusively. Although the majority of participants with jobs prior to arrest did not lose their job as a result of incarceration prior to release, 30 percent of participants with a job prior to arrest noted losing their job as a consequence of incarceration. In addition, close to a majority of those who did lose their jobs were incarcerated for between 1 and 3 days prior to release suggesting that the job loss was not the result of an extended incarceration period. Finally, participants who are released on recognizance have slightly more favorable views on procedural justice compared to those released on a money bond. Discussion: This study offers unique insight into the several and interrelated reasons defendants remain in detention despite being offered the opportunity to post a money bond. It also shows the real and potential concerns, particularly related to employment and child living situations, of pretrial defendants both released and in detention. In clarifying the reasons certain defendants do not post bond while others do, and by exploring collateral consequences, this study opens the door to additional research opportunities, including potentially linking self-report survey data with administrative data, to add greater clarity to the pretrial process.},

This is despite the fact that most analysts expect that the higher levels of urban black homicide are due in part to the higher levels of urban black poverty. The present research introduces a more meaningful, spatially based measure of concentrated poverty and argues that the effect of concentrated poverty on homicide rates should be the same for both racial groups. The hypotheses are tested with race-disaggregated data for a sample of central cities circa 1990. The results suggest that, when poverty is measured as a linear spatially based phenomenon, in is a more important determinat of race-specific homicide rates than overall city levels of disadvantage and that the concentration of poverty increases both black and white homicide rather equally.},

Measured at the state level, the top 10 percent of income earners amassed roughly 43\% of total income, and economic growth only enhanced this inequality between the ultrarich and the rest of citizens. This paper examines whether social capital plays a positive role in mitigating income inequality at the state level, with an emphasis on racial diversity and its relation to church attendance. The empirical findings demonstrate that social capital, whether measured by Robert Putnam’s state-level social capital index (SCI), or a new measure that improves SCI’s original measurement, fails to improve income equality. In comparison, racial diversity is found to be a consistent contributor of income inequality. In states with a greater proportion of minority population, the ultra-rich tend to share more wealth and social capital potentially facilitates the ultra-rich to enjoy the benefit of economic growth.},

  abstract = {Statement of Purpose: A tremendous body of research has accumulated on the topic of racial and ethnic discrimination in sentencing. These studies have produced seemingly divergent findings. The purpose of this research is to conduct an objective, comprehensive, and systematic review of the literature regarding the relationship between race/ethnicity and sentencing outcomes using quantitative methods (i.e., meta-analysis), which remedy many of the shortcomings inherent in the extant qualitative (narrative) reviews. Further, this research goes beyond simply addressing the question of whether there is unwarranted racial/ethnic sentencing disparity, but also addresses the question of why this body of research produces such inconsistent findings.},

  abstract = {Purpose Economic hardship and crime is always a debatable issue in the political economy literature. Some authors define poverty leads to crime some are completely opposite. The purpose of this paper is to find out the impact of poverty on crime in the USA. Using time series data of USA over the period from 1965 to 2016, this study applies autoregressive distributed lag approach to identify the effect of poverty on crime. The outcomes confirm a positive co-integrating relationship between poverty and property crime. It can be argued that poverty ultimately leads property crime in long run in the USA. However, unemployment and GDP exhibit neither long-run nor short-run relationship with property crime and they are not cointegrated for the calculated period. The subject of this paper helps to explain and analyze the nexus between poverty and crime in the USA. Government and policymakers should focus more on poverty rather than unemployment alone to control property crime. This study attempts to identify the consequences of economic hardship and poverty on the crime in the advanced economy like USA.},

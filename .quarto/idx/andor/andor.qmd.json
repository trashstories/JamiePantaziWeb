I know this already. Alone, unsure, dwarfed by the scale of the enemy.\\\n**Remember** this. Freedom is a pure idea.\\\nIt occurs spontaneously and without instruction. Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they've already enlisted in the cause.\\\n**Remember** that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward.\\\nAnd then **remember** this. The Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear.\\\n**Remember** that. And know this, the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance will have flooded the banks of the Empire's authority and then there will be one too many. One single thing will break the siege.\\\n**Remember** this. Try.\n\n# Luthen's Monologue\n\nLonni: And what do you sacrifice?\n\nLuthen: Calm. Kindness. Kinship. Love.\\\nI've given up all chance at inner peace.\\\nI've made my mind a sunless space.\\\nI share my dreams with ghosts.\\\nI wake up every day to an equation I wrote 15 years ago from which there's only one conclusion, I'm damned for what I do.\\\nMy anger, my ego, my unwillingness to yield, my eagerness to fight, they've set me on a path from which there is no escape.\\\nI yearned to be a savior against injustice without contemplating the cost and by the time I looked down there was no longer any ground beneath my feet.\\\nWhat is my sacrifice?\\\nI'm condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them.\\\nI burn my decency for someone else's future.\\\nI burn my life to make a sunrise that I know I'll never see.\\\nAnd the ego that started this fight will never have a mirror or an audience or the light of gratitude.\\\nSo what do I sacrifice?\\\nEverything!\\\nYou'll stay with me, Lonni. I need all the heroes I can get.\n\n# Maarva's Funeral\n\nMy name is Maarva Carassi Andor.\n\nI'm honored to stand before you. I'm honored to be a Daughter of Ferrix, and honored to be worthy of the stone. Strange, I... feel as if I can see it. I was six, I think, first time I touched a funerary stone. Heard our music, felt our history. Holding my sister's hand as we walked all the way from Fountain Square. Where you stand now, I've been more times than I can remember. I always wanted to be lifted. I was always eager, always waiting to be inspired. I remember every time it happened, every time the dead lifted me...With their truth.\n\nAnd now I'm dead. And I yearn to lift you. Not because I want to shine or even be remembered. It's because I want you to go on. I want Ferrix to continue. In my waning hours, that's what comforts me most. But I fear for you. We've been sleeping. We've had each other, and Ferrix, our work, our days. We had each other, and they left us alone. We kept the trade lanes open, and they left us alone. We took their money and ignored them, we kept their engines churning, and the moment they pulled away, we forgot them.\n\nBecause we had each other. We had Ferrix. But we were sleeping. I've been sleeping. And I've been turning away from the truth I wanted not to face. There is a wound that won't heal at the center of the galaxy. There is a darkness reaching like rust ( *Glitches* ) into everything around us. We let it grow, and now it's here. It's here, and it's not visiting anymore. It wants to stay. The Empire is a disease that thrives in darkness, it is never more alive than when we sleep.\n\nIt's easy for the dead to tell you to fight, and maybe it's true, maybe fighting is useless.\n\nPerhaps it's too late. But I'll tell you this... If I could do it again, I'd wake up early and be fighting these bastards...from the start.\n\nFight the Empire!\n\n# Maarva's Message to Cassian\n\nTell him, none of this is his fault. It was already burning. He's just the first spark of the fire. Tell him, he knows everything he needs to know and feels everything he needs to feel. And when the day comes, and those two pull together, he will be an unstoppable force for good. Tell him... I love him more than anything he could ever do wrong.\n\n# Cassian and Nemik\n\nCassian: That's an old one.\n\nNemik: Old and true. And sturdy. One of the best navigational tools ever built. Can't be jammed or intercepted. Something breaks, you can fix it yourself.\n\nCassian: Hard to learn.\n\nNemik: Yes, but once you've mastered it, you're free. We've grown reliant on Imperial tech, and we've made ourselves vulnerable. There's a growing list of things we've known and forgotten, things they've pushed us to forget. Things like freedom.\n\nSkeen: Nemik sees oppression everywhere.\n\nNemik: Skeen pretends not to listen, but I know the message is sinking in.\n\nSkeen: He's writin' a manifesto.\n\nCassian: Did he tell you?\n\nSkeen: Apparently, the only thing keepin' us from liberty is a few more ideas.\n\nCassian: Few more ideas. ( *Chuckles* )\n\nNemik: It's so confusing, isn't it? So much going wrong, so much to say, and all of it happening so quickly. The pace of repression outstrips our ability to understand it. And that is the real trick of the Imperial thought machine. It's easier to hide behind 40 atrocities than a single incident. But they have a fight on their hands, don't they? Our elemental rights are such a simple thing to hold, they will have to shake the galaxy hard to loosen our grip.\n\nSkeen: I'd like to hear what Clem believes.\n\nCassian: I know what I'm against. Everything else will have to wait.\n\nNemik: You're my ideal reader.\n\n( *Skeen scoffs* )\n\nCassian: Now you've done it.\n\nHaven't titled it yet. I've been waiting. It's a work in progress, and I know that there's a great deal left to say. I mean, look. Right here. Fresh inspiration. Two seemingly random objects, and yet this charts an astral path, this maps the trail of political consciousness. Both systems based on truth, both navigating toward clear and achievable outcomes.

I'm speaking to you from the command center on Level Eight.\\\nWe are, at this moment, in control of the facility.\\\n( *Breathes heavily* )\\\nIs that the best you got?\\\nHow long we hang on, how far we get, how many of us make it out, all of that is now up to us.\\\nWe have deactivated every floor in the facility. All floors are cold. Wherever you are right now, get up, stop the work. Get out of your cells, take charge and start **climb**ing. They don't have enough guards and they know it. If we wait until they figure that out, it'll be too late.\\\n( *Shudders* )\\\nWe will never have a better chance than this and \"I would rather die trying to take them down\"than giving them what they want.\"\\\nWe know they fried a hundred men on Level Two.\\\nWe know that they are making up our sentences as we go along.\\\nWe know that no one outside here knows what's happening.

You see someone who's confused, someone who is lost, you get them moving and you keep them moving until we put this place behind us.\\\nThere are 5,000 of us. If we can fight half as hard as we've been working, we will be home in no time. One way out! One way out!\\\nOne way out!\\\nPrisoners ( *chanting* ): One way out!\\\nKino: One way out!

I know this already. Alone, unsure, dwarfed by the scale of the enemy.\\\n**Remember** this. Freedom is a pure idea.\\\nIt occurs spontaneously and without instruction. Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they've already enlisted in the cause.\\\n**Remember** that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward.\\\nAnd then **remember** this. The Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear.\\\n**Remember** that. And know this, the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance will have flooded the banks of the Empire's authority and then there will be one too many. One single thing will break the siege.\\\n**Remember** this. Try.\n\n# Luthen's Monologue\n\nLonni: And what do you sacrifice?\n\nLuthen: Calm. Kindness. Kinship. Love.\\\nI've given up all chance at inner peace.\\\nI've made my mind a sunless space.\\\nI share my dreams with ghosts.\\\nI wake up every day to an equation I wrote 15 years ago from which there's only one conclusion, I'm damned for what I do.\\\nMy anger, my ego, my unwillingness to yield, my eagerness to fight, they've set me on a path from which there is no escape.\\\nI yearned to be a savior against injustice without contemplating the cost and by the time I looked down there was no longer any ground beneath my feet.\\\nWhat is my sacrifice?\\\nI'm condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them.\\\nI burn my decency for someone else's future.\\\nI burn my life to make a sunrise that I know I'll never see.\\\nAnd the ego that started this fight will never have a mirror or an audience or the light of gratitude.\\\nSo what do I sacrifice?\\\nEverything!\\\nYou'll stay with me, Lonni. I need all the heroes I can get.\n\n# Maarva's Funeral\n\nMy name is Maarva Carassi Andor.\n\nI'm honored to stand before you. I'm honored to be a Daughter of Ferrix, and honored to be worthy of the stone. Strange, I... feel as if I can see it. I was six, I think, first time I touched a funerary stone. Heard our music, felt our history. Holding my sister's hand as we walked all the way from Fountain Square. Where you stand now, I've been more times than I can remember. I always wanted to be lifted. I was always eager, always waiting to be inspired. I remember every time it happened, every time the dead lifted me...With their truth.\n\nAnd now I'm dead. And I yearn to lift you. Not because I want to shine or even be remembered. It's because I want you to go on. I want Ferrix to continue. In my waning hours, that's what comforts me most. But I fear for you. We've been sleeping. We've had each other, and Ferrix, our work, our days. We had each other, and they left us alone. We kept the trade lanes open, and they left us alone. We took their money and ignored them, we kept their engines churning, and the moment they pulled away, we forgot them.\n\nBecause we had each other. We had Ferrix. But we were sleeping. I've been sleeping. And I've been turning away from the truth I wanted not to face. There is a wound that won't heal at the center of the galaxy. There is a darkness reaching like rust ( *Glitches* ) into everything around us. We let it grow, and now it's here. It's here, and it's not visiting anymore. It wants to stay. The Empire is a disease that thrives in darkness, it is never more alive than when we sleep.\n\nIt's easy for the dead to tell you to fight, and maybe it's true, maybe fighting is useless.\n\nPerhaps it's too late. But I'll tell you this... If I could do it again, I'd wake up early and be fighting these bastards...from the start.\n\nFight the Empire!\n\n# Maarva's Message to Cassian\n\nTell him, none of this is his fault. It was already burning. He's just the first spark of the fire. Tell him, he knows everything he needs to know and feels everything he needs to feel. And when the day comes, and those two pull together, he will be an unstoppable force for good. Tell him... I love him more than anything he could ever do wrong.\n\n# Cassian and Nemik\n\nCassian: That's an old one.\n\nNemik: Old and true. And sturdy. One of the best navigational tools ever built. Can't be jammed or intercepted. Something breaks, you can fix it yourself.\n\nCassian: Hard to learn.\n\nNemik: Yes, but once you've mastered it, you're free. We've grown reliant on Imperial tech, and we've made ourselves vulnerable. There's a growing list of things we've known and forgotten, things they've pushed us to forget. Things like freedom.\n\nSkeen: Nemik sees oppression everywhere.\n\nNemik: Skeen pretends not to listen, but I know the message is sinking in.\n\nSkeen: He's writin' a manifesto.\n\nCassian: Did he tell you?\n\nSkeen: Apparently, the only thing keepin' us from liberty is a few more ideas.\n\nCassian: Few more ideas. ( *Chuckles* )\n\nNemik: It's so confusing, isn't it? So much going wrong, so much to say, and all of it happening so quickly. The pace of repression outstrips our ability to understand it. And that is the real trick of the Imperial thought machine. It's easier to hide behind 40 atrocities than a single incident. But they have a fight on their hands, don't they? Our elemental rights are such a simple thing to hold, they will have to shake the galaxy hard to loosen our grip.\n\nSkeen: I'd like to hear what Clem believes.\n\nCassian: I know what I'm against. Everything else will have to wait.\n\nNemik: You're my ideal reader.\n\n( *Skeen scoffs* )\n\nCassian: Now you've done it.\n\nHaven't titled it yet. I've been waiting. It's a work in progress, and I know that there's a great deal left to say. I mean, look. Right here. Fresh inspiration. Two seemingly random objects, and yet this charts an astral path, this maps the trail of political consciousness. Both systems based on truth, both navigating toward clear and achievable outcomes. Basic facts expanded to...\n\nTaramyn: ( *Interrupting* )
